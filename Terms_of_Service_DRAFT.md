Customer Data does not include Generated Content or Usage Data that has been aggregated and de-identified.

2. License Grant and Use Rights
License: Subject to Customer's compliance with these Terms and payment of applicable fees set forth in the Order Form, Vividly grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license during the Subscription Term to access and use the Service solely for Customer's internal educational purposes, and to permit Authorized Users to access and use the Service for such purposes.
Authorized Users: Customer is responsible for managing Authorized User access and ensuring all Authorized Users comply with these Terms. Customer shall promptly notify Vividly of any unauthorized use. Access credentials may not be shared among individuals.
User Roles: The Service provides distinct roles (e.g., District Administrator, School Administrator, Teacher, Student) with varying permissions as described in the Service documentation or applicable Order Form. Customer is responsible for assigning appropriate roles.
3. Acceptable Use
Customer and its Authorized Users shall not:
Use the Service for any illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing, or offensive purposes.
Attempt to bypass or compromise any security measures or access controls.
Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service or third-party data contained therein.
Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Service software.

4. Service Availability
Vividly will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Service available, subject to planned downtime (for which Vividly shall give advance notice) and any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond Vividly's reasonable control (force majeure). Vividly does not guarantee specific uptime percentages unless otherwise agreed in a separate Service Level Agreement (SLA).
5. Customer Data and Privacy
Ownership: As between Vividly and Customer, Customer exclusively owns all rights, title, and interest in and to all Customer Data.
License to Vividly: Customer grants Vividly a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, display, and distribute Customer Data solely as necessary to provide, maintain, and improve the Service in accordance with these Terms and the Vividly Data Privacy Policy.
Privacy Compliance: Vividly will handle all Customer Data, particularly PII from student Education Records, in compliance with the Vividly Data Privacy Policy [Link to Privacy Policy] and applicable laws including FERPA and COPPA. Vividly acts as a "School Official" under FERPA as further detailed in the Privacy Policy. Customer represents and warrants that it has obtained necessary consents (including parental consent via its authority under COPPA for educational purposes) for Vividly to collect and process Customer Data as described herein.
6. AI-Generated Content
Ownership: Customer owns the specific Generated Content (scripts, audio, video) created by the Service for its Authorized Users.
Vividly Caching Rights: Notwithstanding Customer's ownership, Customer grants Vividly a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free right and license to retain, use, reproduce, modify, and display Generated Content in an aggregated and de-identified manner (disassociated from any specific user or Customer Data) for the purposes of caching, service efficiency, and improving the Service. Specifically, Vividly may cache Generated Content keyed by non-identifiable attributes (e.g., topic ID, canonical interest, style) to serve future identical requests from any customer more efficiently and cost-effectively.
Accuracy Disclaimer: Generated Content is produced using artificial intelligence based on OER sources and user inputs. While Vividly strives for accuracy, GENERATED CONTENT IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. Vividly expressly disclaims any warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or suitability of Generated Content for any particular purpose. Generated Content is intended as a supplemental educational tool and should not be relied upon as a sole source of information or instruction. Customer and Authorized Users are responsible for verifying the accuracy and appropriateness of Generated Content.
Responsibility: Customer is responsible for Authorized Users' use of Generated Content and ensuring such use complies with acceptable use policies and educational standards.
7. Intellectual Property
Vividly IP: Vividly retains all rights, title, and interest in and to the Service, its underlying software, technology, documentation, aggregated/anonymized usage data, and any modifications or derivative works thereof, excluding Customer Data and Customer-owned Generated Content.

8. Confidentiality
Each party agrees to treat the other party's Confidential Information (non-public information disclosed by one party to the other) with the same degree of care as it uses for its own similar information, but no less than reasonable care. Confidential Information shall not be disclosed to third parties except as necessary for service provision (subject to confidentiality obligations) or as required by law.
9. Term and Termination

Termination for Cause: Either party may terminate these Terms for cause upon written notice if the other party materially breaches these Terms and fails to cure such breach within [e.g., 30] days.
Effect of Termination: Upon termination, Customer's right to access the Service ceases. Vividly will make Customer Data available for export for a limited period (e.g., 30 days) and thereafter will delete Customer Data in accordance with the Data Privacy Policy and applicable law. Obligations related to confidentiality, intellectual property, limitation of liability, and indemnification shall survive termination.

Cap on Liability: EXCEPT FOR OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 13 (INDEMNIFICATION) OR A PARTY'S BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY OR VIOLATION OF THE OTHER PARTY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, EACH PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER HEREUNDER IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE INCIDENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.
13. Indemnification
By Vividly: Vividly shall defend Customer against any claim brought by a third party alleging that the Service (excluding Customer Data and Generated Content) infringes their intellectual property rights and shall pay damages finally awarded or settlement amounts agreed to, provided Customer promptly notifies Vividly of the claim and cooperates in the defense.

14. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Tennessee, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Any disputes arising under these Terms shall be resolved first through good faith negotiation. If negotiation fails, disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration in Nashville, Tennessee, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association, or, if arbitration is not permitted, in the state or federal courts located in Davidson County, Tennessee.
15. General Provisions
Entire Agreement: These Terms, together with the Data Privacy Policy and any applicable Order Forms, constitute the entire agreement between the parties regarding the Service and supersede all prior agreements.
Modifications: Vividly may modify these Terms upon notice to Customer (e.g., via email to the District Administrator). Continued use of the Service after such notice constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms. Material changes will typically require advance notice.
Assignment: Neither party may assign these Terms without the prior written consent of the other, except in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all assets.
Notices: Notices shall be in writing and sent to the addresses specified in the Order Form or as otherwise updated by the parties.
Severability: If any provision is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
Waiver: No waiver of any breach shall constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.
