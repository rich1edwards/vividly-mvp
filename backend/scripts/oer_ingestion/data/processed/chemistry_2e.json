          "text": "mind, the content of this textbook has been developed and arranged to provide a logical progression from\nfundamental to more advanced concepts of chemical science. Topics are introduced within the context of\nfamiliar experiences whenever possible, treated with an appropriate rigor to satisfy the intellect of the learner,\nand reinforced in subsequent discussions of related content. The organization and pedagogical features were\ndeveloped and vetted with feedback from chemistry educators dedicated to the project.\nChanges to the second edition\nOpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. In the case\nof Chemistry 2e, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in\nthe following ways:\nContent revisions for clarity and accuracy. The revision plan varied by chapter based on need. About five\nchapters were extensively rewritten and another twelve chapters were substantially revised to improve the\nreadability and clarity of the narrative.\nExample and end-of-chapter exercises. The example and end-of-chapter exercises in several chapters were\nsubjected to a rigorous accuracy check and revised to correct any errors, and additional exercises were added\nto several chapters to more fully support chapter content.\nArt and illustrations. Under the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those\nwell-versed in creating accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes to much of the art in the first edition\nof Chemistry. The revisions included correcting errors, redesigning illustrations to improve understanding,\nand recoloring for overall consistency.\nAccessibility improvements. As with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Chemistry was created with a\nfocus on accessibility. We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. To\naccommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for\ncomprehensiveness and clarity. Many illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is\nimportant for some visually impaired students. Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded\nto improve accessibility.\nPedagogical foundation and features\nThroughout Chemistry 2e, you will find features that draw the students into scientific inquiry by taking\nselected topics a step further. Students and educators alike will appreciate discussions in these feature boxes.\n•\nChemistry in Everyday Life ties chemistry concepts to everyday issues and real-world applications of\nscience that students encounter in their lives. Topics include cell phones, solar thermal energy power\nplants, plastics recycling, and measuring blood pressure.\n•\nHow Sciences Interconnect feature boxes discuss chemistry in context of its interconnectedness with\nother scientific disciplines. Topics include neurotransmitters, greenhouse gases and climate change, and\nproteins and enzymes.\n•\nPortrait of a Chemist presents a short bio and an introduction to the work of prominent figures from\nhistory and present day so that students can see the “faces” of contributors in this field as well as science\nin action.\nComprehensive art program\nOur art program is designed to enhance students’ understanding of concepts through clear, effective\nillustrations, diagrams, and photographs.\n2\nPreface\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

          "text": "ancestors chipped pieces of flint into useful tools and carved wood into statues and toys. These endeavors\ninvolved changing the shape of a substance without changing the substance itself. But as our knowledge\nincreased, humans began to change the composition of the substances as well—clay was converted into\npottery, hides were cured to make garments, copper ores were transformed into copper tools and weapons,\nand grain was made into bread.\nHumans began to practice chemistry when they learned to control fire and use it to cook, make pottery, and\nsmelt metals. Subsequently, they began to separate and use specific components of matter. A variety of drugs\nsuch as aloe, myrrh, and opium were isolated from plants. Dyes, such as indigo and Tyrian purple, were\nextracted from plant and animal matter. Metals were combined to form alloys—for example, copper and tin\nwere mixed together to make bronze—and more elaborate smelting techniques produced iron. Alkalis were\nextracted from ashes, and soaps were prepared by combining these alkalis with fats. Alcohol was produced by\nfermentation and purified by distillation.\nAttempts to understand the behavior of matter extend back for more than 2500 years. As early as the sixth\ncentury BC, Greek philosophers discussed a system in which water was the basis of all things. You may have\nheard of the Greek postulate that matter consists of four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. Subsequently, an\namalgamation of chemical technologies and philosophical speculations was spread from Egypt, China, and the\neastern Mediterranean by alchemists, who endeavored to transform “base metals” such as lead into “noble\nmetals” like gold, and to create elixirs to cure disease and extend life (Figure 1.2).\nFIGURE 1.2\n(a) This portrayal shows an alchemist’s workshop circa 1580. Although alchemy made some useful\ncontributions to how to manipulate matter, it was not scientific by modern standards. (b) While the equipment used\nby Alma Levant Hayden in this 1952 picture might not seem as sleek as you might find in a lab today, her approach\nwas highly methodical and carefully recorded. A department head at the FDA, Hayden is most famous for exposing\nan aggressively marketed anti-cancer drug as nothing more than an unhelpful solution of common substances.\n(credit a: Chemical Heritage Foundation; b: NIH History Office)\nFrom alchemy came the historical progressions that led to modern chemistry: the isolation of drugs from\nnatural sources, such as plants and animals. But while many of the substances extracted or processed from\nthose natural sources were critical in the treatment of diseases, many were scarce. For example, progesterone,\nwhich is critical to women's health, became available as a medicine in 1935, but its animal sources produced\nextremely small quantities, limiting its availability and increasing its expense. Likewise, in the 1940s,\ncortisone came into use to treat arthritis and other disorders and injuries, but it took a 36-step process to\nsynthesize. Chemist Percy Lavon Julian turned to a more plentiful source: soybeans. Previously, Julian had\ndeveloped a lab to isolate soy protein, which was used in firefighting among other applications. He focused on\nusing the soy sterols—substances mostly used in plant membranes—and was able to quickly produce\nprogesterone and later testosterone and other hormones. He later developed a process to do the same for\ncortisone, and laid the groundwork for modern drug design. Since soybeans and similar plant sources were\nextremely plentiful, the drugs soon became widely available, saving many lives.\n10\n1 • Essential Ideas\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

          "text": "Chemistry: The Central Science\nChemistry is sometimes referred to as “the central science” due to its interconnectedness with a vast array of\nother STEM disciplines (STEM stands for areas of study in the science, technology, engineering, and math\nfields). Chemistry and the language of chemists play vital roles in biology, medicine, materials science,\nforensics, environmental science, and many other fields (Figure 1.3). The basic principles of physics are\nessential for understanding many aspects of chemistry, and there is extensive overlap between many\nsubdisciplines within the two fields, such as chemical physics and nuclear chemistry. Mathematics, computer\nscience, and information theory provide important tools that help us calculate, interpret, describe, and\ngenerally make sense of the chemical world. Biology and chemistry converge in biochemistry, which is crucial\nto understanding the many complex factors and processes that keep living organisms (such as us) alive.\nChemical engineering, materials science, and nanotechnology combine chemical principles and empirical\nfindings to produce useful substances, ranging from gasoline to fabrics to electronics. Agriculture, food\nscience, veterinary science, and brewing and wine making help provide sustenance in the form of food and\ndrink to the world’s population. Medicine, pharmacology, biotechnology, and botany identify and produce\nsubstances that help keep us healthy. Environmental science, geology, oceanography, and atmospheric science\nincorporate many chemical ideas to help us better understand and protect our physical world. Chemical ideas\nare used to help understand the universe in astronomy and cosmology.\nFIGURE 1.3\nKnowledge of chemistry is central to understanding a wide range of scientific disciplines. This diagram\nshows just some of the interrelationships between chemistry and other fields.\nWhat are some changes in matter that are essential to daily life? Digesting and assimilating food, synthesizing\npolymers that are used to make clothing, containers, cookware, and credit cards, and refining crude oil into\ngasoline and other products are just a few examples. As you proceed through this course, you will discover\nmany different examples of changes in the composition and structure of matter, how to classify these changes\nand how they occurred, their causes, the changes in energy that accompany them, and the principles and laws\ninvolved. As you learn about these things, you will be learning chemistry, the study of the composition,\nproperties, and interactions of matter. The practice of chemistry is not limited to chemistry books or\nlaboratories: It happens whenever someone is involved in changes in matter or in conditions that may lead to\nsuch changes.\nThe Scientific Method\nChemistry is a science based on observation and experimentation. Doing chemistry involves attempting to\nanswer questions and explain observations in terms of the laws and theories of chemistry, using procedures\nthat are accepted by the scientific community. There is no single route to answering a question or explaining\nan observation, but there is an aspect common to every approach: Each uses knowledge based on experiments\nthat can be reproduced to verify the results. Some routes involve a hypothesis, a tentative explanation of\n1.1 • Chemistry in Context\n11",

A hypothesis is tested by\nexperimentation, calculation, and/or comparison with the experiments of others and then refined as needed.\nSome hypotheses are attempts to explain the behavior that is summarized in laws. The laws of science\nsummarize a vast number of experimental observations, and describe or predict some facet of the natural\nworld. If such a hypothesis turns out to be capable of explaining a large body of experimental data, it can reach\nthe status of a theory. Scientific theories are well-substantiated, comprehensive, testable explanations of\nparticular aspects of nature. Theories are accepted because they provide satisfactory explanations, but they\ncan be modified if new data become available. The path of discovery that leads from question and observation\nto law or hypothesis to theory, combined with experimental verification of the hypothesis and any necessary\nmodification of the theory, is called the scientific method (Figure 1.4).\nFIGURE 1.4\nThe scientific method follows a process similar to the one shown in this diagram. All the key\ncomponents are shown, in roughly the right order. Scientific progress is seldom neat and clean: It requires open\ninquiry and the reworking of questions and ideas in response to findings.\nThe Domains of Chemistry\nChemists study and describe the behavior of matter and energy in three different domains: macroscopic,\nmicroscopic, and symbolic. These domains provide different ways of considering and describing chemical\nbehavior.\nMacro is a Greek word that means “large.” The macroscopic domain is familiar to us: It is the realm of\neveryday things that are large enough to be sensed directly by human sight or touch. In daily life, this includes\nthe food you eat and the breeze you feel on your face. The macroscopic domain includes everyday and\nlaboratory chemistry, where we observe and measure physical and chemical properties such as density,\nsolubility, and flammability.\nMicro comes from Greek and means “small.” The microscopic domain of chemistry is often visited in the\nimagination. Some aspects of the microscopic domain are visible through standard optical microscopes, for\nexample, many biological cells. More sophisticated instruments are capable of imaging even smaller entities\nsuch as molecules and atoms (see Figure 1.5 (b)).\nHowever, most of the subjects in the microscopic domain of chemistry are too small to be seen even with the\nmost advanced microscopes and may only be pictured in the mind. Other components of the microscopic\n12\n1 • Essential Ideas\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Chemical symbols (such as those used in the periodic table), chemical formulas,\nand chemical equations are part of the symbolic domain, as are graphs, drawings, and calculations. These\nsymbols play an important role in chemistry because they help interpret the behavior of the macroscopic\ndomain in terms of the components of the microscopic domain. One of the challenges for students learning\nchemistry is recognizing that the same symbols can represent different things in the macroscopic and\nmicroscopic domains, and one of the features that makes chemistry fascinating is the use of a domain that\nmust be imagined to explain behavior in a domain that can be observed.\nA helpful way to understand the three domains is via the essential and ubiquitous substance of water. That\nwater is a liquid at moderate temperatures, will freeze to form a solid at lower temperatures, and boil to form a\ngas at higher temperatures (Figure 1.5) are macroscopic observations. But some properties of water fall into\nthe microscopic domain—what cannot be observed with the naked eye. The description of water as comprising\ntwo hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, and the explanation of freezing and boiling in terms of attractions\nbetween these molecules, is within the microscopic arena. The formula H2O, which can describe water at\neither the macroscopic or microscopic levels, is an example of the symbolic domain. The abbreviations (g) for\ngas, (s) for solid, and (l) for liquid are also symbolic.\nFIGURE 1.5\n(a) Moisture in the air, icebergs, and the ocean represent water in the macroscopic domain. (b) At the\nmolecular level (microscopic domain), gas molecules are far apart and disorganized, solid water molecules are close\ntogether and organized, and liquid molecules are close together and disorganized. (c) The formula H2O symbolizes\nwater, and (g), (s), and (l) symbolize its phases. Note that clouds are actually comprised of either very small liquid\nwater droplets or solid water crystals; gaseous water in our atmosphere is not visible to the naked eye, although it\nmay be sensed as humidity.

Solids and liquids are\nmore obviously matter: We can see that they take up space, and their weight tells us that they have mass. Gases\nare also matter; if gases did not take up space, a balloon would not inflate (increase its volume) when filled with\ngas.\nSolids, liquids, and gases are the three states of matter commonly found on earth (Figure 1.6). A solid is rigid\nand possesses a definite shape. A liquid flows and takes the shape of its container, except that it forms a flat or\nslightly curved upper surface when acted upon by gravity. (In zero gravity, liquids assume a spherical shape.)\nBoth liquid and solid samples have volumes that are very nearly independent of pressure. A gas takes both the\nshape and volume of its container.\nFIGURE 1.6\nThe three most common states or phases of matter are solid, liquid, and gas.\nA fourth state of matter, plasma, occurs naturally in the interiors of stars. A plasma is a gaseous state of matter\nthat contains appreciable numbers of electrically charged particles (Figure 1.7). The presence of these charged\nparticles imparts unique properties to plasmas that justify their classification as a state of matter distinct from\ngases. In addition to stars, plasmas are found in some other high-temperature environments (both natural and\nman-made), such as lightning strikes, certain television screens, and specialized analytical instruments used\nto detect trace amounts of metals.\n14\n1 • Essential Ideas\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

          "text": "FIGURE 1.7\nA plasma torch can be used to cut metal. (credit: “Hypertherm”/Wikimedia Commons)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nIn a tiny cell in a plasma television, the plasma emits ultraviolet light, which in turn causes the display at that\nlocation to appear a specific color. The composite of these tiny dots of color makes up the image that you see.\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/16plasma) to learn more about plasma and the places you encounter it.\nSome samples of matter appear to have properties of solids, liquids, and/or gases at the same time. This can\noccur when the sample is composed of many small pieces. For example, we can pour sand as if it were a liquid\nbecause it is composed of many small grains of solid sand. Matter can also have properties of more than one\nstate when it is a mixture, such as with clouds. Clouds appear to behave somewhat like gases, but they are\nactually mixtures of air (gas) and tiny particles of water (liquid or solid).\nThe mass of an object is a measure of the amount of matter in it. One way to measure an object’s mass is to\nmeasure the force it takes to accelerate the object. It takes much more force to accelerate a car than a bicycle\nbecause the car has much more mass. A more common way to determine the mass of an object is to use a\nbalance to compare its mass with a standard mass.\nAlthough weight is related to mass, it is not the same thing. Weight refers to the force that gravity exerts on an\nobject. This force is directly proportional to the mass of the object. The weight of an object changes as the force\nof gravity changes, but its mass does not. An astronaut’s mass does not change just because she goes to the\nmoon. But her weight on the moon is only one-sixth her earth-bound weight because the moon’s gravity is only\none-sixth that of the earth’s. She may feel “weightless” during her trip when she experiences negligible\nexternal forces (gravitational or any other), although she is, of course, never “massless.”\nThe law of conservation of matter summarizes many scientific observations about matter: It states that there\nis no detectable change in the total quantity of matter present when matter converts from one type to another\n(a chemical change) or changes among solid, liquid, or gaseous states (a physical change). Brewing beer and\nthe operation of batteries provide examples of the conservation of matter (Figure 1.8). During the brewing of\nbeer, the ingredients (water, yeast, grains, malt, hops, and sugar) are converted into beer (water, alcohol,\ncarbonation, and flavoring substances) with no actual loss of substance. This is most clearly seen during the\nbottling process, when glucose turns into ethanol and carbon dioxide, and the total mass of the substances\ndoes not change. This can also be seen in a lead-acid car battery: The original substances (lead, lead oxide, and\nsulfuric acid), which are capable of producing electricity, are changed into other substances (lead sulfate and\nwater) that do not produce electricity, with no change in the actual amount of matter.\n1.2 • Phases and Classification of Matter\n15",

(b) The mass of the lead, lead oxide, and sulfuric acid consumed by the\nproduction of electricity is exactly equal to the mass of lead sulfate and water that is formed.\nAlthough this conservation law holds true for all conversions of matter, convincing examples are few and far\nbetween because, outside of the controlled conditions in a laboratory, we seldom collect all of the material that\nis produced during a particular conversion. For example, when you eat, digest, and assimilate food, all of the\nmatter in the original food is preserved. But because some of the matter is incorporated into your body, and\nmuch is excreted as various types of waste, it is challenging to verify by measurement.\nClassifying Matter\nMatter can be classified into several categories. Two broad categories are mixtures and pure substances. A\npure substance has a constant composition. All specimens of a pure substance have exactly the same makeup\nand properties. Any sample of sucrose (table sugar) consists of 42.1% carbon, 6.5% hydrogen, and 51.4%\noxygen by mass. Any sample of sucrose also has the same physical properties, such as melting point, color, and\nsweetness, regardless of the source from which it is isolated.\nPure substances may be divided into two classes: elements and compounds. Pure substances that cannot be\nbroken down into simpler substances by chemical changes are called elements. Iron, silver, gold, aluminum,\nsulfur, oxygen, and copper are familiar examples of the more than 100 known elements, of which about 90\noccur naturally on the earth, and two dozen or so have been created in laboratories.\nPure substances that are comprised of two or more elements are called compounds. Compounds may be\nbroken down by chemical changes to yield either elements or other compounds, or both. Mercury(II) oxide, an\norange, crystalline solid, can be broken down by heat into the elements mercury and oxygen (Figure 1.9).\nWhen heated in the absence of air, the compound sucrose is broken down into the element carbon and the\ncompound water. (The initial stage of this process, when the sugar is turning brown, is known as\ncaramelization—this is what imparts the characteristic sweet and nutty flavor to caramel apples, caramelized\nonions, and caramel). Silver(I) chloride is a white solid that can be broken down into its elements, silver and\nchlorine, by absorption of light. This property is the basis for the use of this compound in photographic films\nand photochromic eyeglasses (those with lenses that darken when exposed to light).\n16\n1 • Essential Ideas\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

You can also view an example of the photochemical decomposition of silver chloride\n(http://openstax.org/l/16silvchloride) (AgCl), the basis of early photography.\nThe properties of combined elements are different from those in the free, or uncombined, state. For example,\nwhite crystalline sugar (sucrose) is a compound resulting from the chemical combination of the element\ncarbon, which is a black solid in one of its uncombined forms, and the two elements hydrogen and oxygen,\nwhich are colorless gases when uncombined. Free sodium, an element that is a soft, shiny, metallic solid, and\nfree chlorine, an element that is a yellow-green gas, combine to form sodium chloride (table salt), a compound\nthat is a white, crystalline solid.\nA mixture is composed of two or more types of matter that can be present in varying amounts and can be\nseparated by physical changes, such as evaporation (you will learn more about this later). A mixture with a\ncomposition that varies from point to point is called a heterogeneous mixture. Italian dressing is an example\nof a heterogeneous mixture (Figure 1.10). Its composition can vary because it may be prepared from varying\namounts of oil, vinegar, and herbs. It is not the same from point to point throughout the mixture—one drop\nmay be mostly vinegar, whereas a different drop may be mostly oil or herbs because the oil and vinegar\nseparate and the herbs settle. Other examples of heterogeneous mixtures are chocolate chip cookies (we can\nsee the separate bits of chocolate, nuts, and cookie dough) and granite (we can see the quartz, mica, feldspar,\nand more).\nA homogeneous mixture, also called a solution, exhibits a uniform composition and appears visually the\nsame throughout. An example of a solution is a sports drink, consisting of water, sugar, coloring, flavoring, and\nelectrolytes mixed together uniformly (Figure 1.10). Each drop of a sports drink tastes the same because each\ndrop contains the same amounts of water, sugar, and other components. Note that the composition of a sports\ndrink can vary—it could be made with somewhat more or less sugar, flavoring, or other components, and still\nbe a sports drink. Other examples of homogeneous mixtures include air, maple syrup, gasoline, and a solution\nof salt in water.\nFIGURE 1.10\n(a) Oil and vinegar salad dressing is a heterogeneous mixture because its composition is not uniform\nthroughout.

Consider the element gold, for example. Imagine cutting a gold nugget in half, then\ncutting one of the halves in half, and repeating this process until a piece of gold remained that was so small\nthat it could not be cut in half (regardless of how tiny your knife may be). This minimally sized piece of gold is\nan atom (from the Greek atomos, meaning “indivisible”) (Figure 1.12). This atom would no longer be gold if it\nwere divided any further.\nFIGURE 1.12\n(a) This photograph shows a gold nugget.

(credit a:\nmodification of work by United States Geological Survey; credit b: modification of work by “Erwinrossen”/Wikimedia\nCommons)\nThe first suggestion that matter is composed of atoms is attributed to the Greek philosophers Leucippus and\nDemocritus, who developed their ideas in the 5th century BCE. However, it was not until the early nineteenth\ncentury that John Dalton (1766–1844), a British schoolteacher with a keen interest in science, supported this\nhypothesis with quantitative measurements. Since that time, repeated experiments have confirmed many\naspects of this hypothesis, and it has become one of the central theories of chemistry. Other aspects of Dalton’s\natomic theory are still used but with minor revisions (details of Dalton’s theory are provided in the chapter on\natoms and molecules).\nAn atom is so small that its size is difficult to imagine. One of the smallest things we can see with our unaided\neye is a single thread of a spider web: These strands are about 1/10,000 of a centimeter (0.0001 cm) in\ndiameter. Although the cross-section of one strand is almost impossible to see without a microscope, it is huge\non an atomic scale. A single carbon atom in the web has a diameter of about 0.000000015 centimeter, and it\nwould take about 7000 carbon atoms to span the diameter of the strand. To put this in perspective, if a carbon\natom were the size of a dime, the cross-section of one strand would be larger than a football field, which would\nrequire about 150 million carbon atom “dimes” to cover it.

A billion lead atoms (1,000,000,000 atoms) weigh\nabout 3\n10−13 grams, a mass that is far too light to be weighed on even the world’s most sensitive balances. It\nwould require over 300,000,000,000,000 lead atoms (300 trillion, or 3\n1014) to be weighed, and they would\nweigh only 0.0000001 gram.\nIt is rare to find collections of individual atoms. Only a few elements, such as the gases helium, neon, and\nargon, consist of a collection of individual atoms that move about independently of one another. Other\nelements, such as the gases hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and chlorine, are composed of units that consist of\npairs of atoms (Figure 1.14). One form of the element phosphorus consists of units composed of four\nphosphorus atoms. The element sulfur exists in various forms, one of which consists of units composed of\neight sulfur atoms. These units are called molecules. A molecule consists of two or more atoms joined by\nstrong forces called chemical bonds. The atoms in a molecule move around as a unit, much like the cans of\nsoda in a six-pack or a bunch of keys joined together on a single key ring. A molecule may consist of two or\nmore identical atoms, as in the molecules found in the elements hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, or it may consist\nof two or more different atoms, as in the molecules found in water. Each water molecule is a unit that contains\ntwo hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Each glucose molecule is a unit that contains 6 carbon atoms, 12\nhydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms. Like atoms, molecules are incredibly small and light. If an ordinary glass\nof water were enlarged to the size of the earth, the water molecules inside it would be about the size of golf\nballs.\nFIGURE 1.14\nThe elements hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur form molecules consisting of two or more\natoms of the same element.

The\nbattery provides an electric current (microscopic) that decomposes water. At the macroscopic level, the liquid\nseparates into the gases hydrogen (on the left) and oxygen (on the right). Symbolically, this change is presented\nby showing how liquid H2O separates into H2 and O2 gases.\nThe breakdown of water involves a rearrangement of the atoms in water molecules into different\nmolecules, each composed of two hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms, respectively. Two water\nmolecules form one oxygen molecule and two hydrogen molecules.

Oxygen is not flammable but is required for\ncombustion of a fuel, and hydrogen is highly flammable and a potent energy source. How might this\nknowledge be applied in our world? One application involves research into more fuel-efficient\ntransportation. Fuel-cell vehicles (FCV) run on hydrogen instead of gasoline (Figure 1.16). They are more\nefficient than vehicles with internal combustion engines, are nonpolluting, and reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions, making us less dependent on fossil fuels.

A physical property is a\ncharacteristic of matter that is not associated with a change in its chemical composition. Familiar examples of\nphysical properties include density, color, hardness, melting and boiling points, and electrical conductivity.\nSome physical properties, such as density and color, may be observed without changing the physical state of\nthe matter. Other physical properties, such as the melting temperature of iron or the freezing temperature of\nwater, can only be observed as matter undergoes a physical change. A physical change is a change in the state\nor properties of matter without any accompanying change in the chemical identities of the substances\ncontained in the matter. Physical changes are observed when wax melts, when sugar dissolves in coffee, and\nwhen steam condenses into liquid water (Figure 1.18). Other examples of physical changes include\nmagnetizing and demagnetizing metals (as is done with common antitheft security tags) and grinding solids\ninto powders (which can sometimes yield noticeable changes in color). In each of these examples, there is a\nchange in the physical state, form, or properties of the substance, but no change in its chemical composition.\nFIGURE 1.17\nAlmost one-third of naturally occurring elements are used to make a cell phone.

Nitroglycerin is very dangerous because it explodes easily; neon poses almost no hazard because\nit is very unreactive.\nFIGURE 1.19\n(a) One of the chemical properties of iron is that it rusts; (b) one of the chemical properties of\nchromium is that it does not.

The formation of rust is a chemical change because rust is a different kind of matter than the iron,\noxygen, and water present before the rust formed. The explosion of nitroglycerin is a chemical change because\nthe gases produced are very different kinds of matter from the original substance. Other examples of chemical\nchanges include reactions that are performed in a lab (such as copper reacting with nitric acid), all forms of\ncombustion (burning), and food being cooked, digested, or rotting (Figure 1.20).\n24\n1 • Essential Ideas\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

If the property depends on the amount of matter present, it\nis an extensive property. The mass and volume of a substance are examples of extensive properties; for\ninstance, a gallon of milk has a larger mass than a cup of milk. The value of an extensive property is directly\nproportional to the amount of matter in question. If the property of a sample of matter does not depend on the\namount of matter present, it is an intensive property. Temperature is an example of an intensive property. If\nthe gallon and cup of milk are each at 20 °C (room temperature), when they are combined, the temperature\nremains at 20 °C. As another example, consider the distinct but related properties of heat and temperature. A\ndrop of hot cooking oil spattered on your arm causes brief, minor discomfort, whereas a pot of hot oil yields\nsevere burns. Both the drop and the pot of oil are at the same temperature (an intensive property), but the pot\nclearly contains much more heat (extensive property).\nChemistry in Everyday Life\nHazard Diamond\nYou may have seen the symbol shown in Figure 1.21 on containers of chemicals in a laboratory or\nworkplace.

A meter is about 3 inches longer than a yard (Figure\n1.23); one meter is about 39.37 inches or 1.094 yards. Longer distances are often reported in kilometers (1 km\n= 1000 m = 103 m), whereas shorter distances can be reported in centimeters (1 cm = 0.01 m = 10−2 m) or\nmillimeters (1 mm = 0.001 m = 10−3 m).\n1.4 • Measurements\n29",

The degree Celsius (°C) is also allowed in the SI system, with both the word “degree” and\nthe degree symbol used for Celsius measurements. Celsius degrees are the same magnitude as those of kelvin,\nbut the two scales place their zeros in different places.

Small and large time intervals can be expressed with the appropriate\nprefixes; for example, 3 microseconds = 0.000003 s = 3\n10−6 and 5 megaseconds = 5,000,000 s = 5\n106 s.\nAlternatively, hours, days, and years can be used.\nDerived SI Units\nWe can derive many units from the seven SI base units. For example, we can use the base unit of length to\ndefine a unit of volume, and the base units of mass and length to define a unit of density.\nVolume\nVolume is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The standard SI unit of volume is defined\nby the base unit of length (Figure 1.25). The standard volume is a cubic meter (m3), a cube with an edge length\nof exactly one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of\nexactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance.\nA more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter (0.1 m, or 10 cm). A cube with edge\nlengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one cubic decimeter (dm3). A liter (L) is the more\ncommon name for the cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts.\nA cubic centimeter (cm3) is the volume of a cube with an edge length of exactly one centimeter. The\nabbreviation cc (for cubic centimeter) is often used by health professionals. A cubic centimeter is equivalent to\na milliliter (mL) and is 1/1000 of a liter.\nFIGURE 1.25\n(a) The relative volumes are shown for cubes of 1 m3, 1 dm3 (1 L), and 1 cm3 (1 mL) (not to scale). (b)\nThe diameter of a dime is compared relative to the edge length of a 1-cm3 (1-mL) cube.\nDensity\nWe use the mass and volume of a substance to determine its density. Thus, the units of density are defined by\nthe base units of mass and length.\nThe density of a substance is the ratio of the mass of a sample of the substance to its volume. The SI unit for\ndensity is the kilogram per cubic meter (kg/m3). For many situations, however, this is an inconvenient unit,\nand we often use grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3) for the densities of solids and liquids, and grams per liter\n(g/L) for gases. Although there are exceptions, most liquids and solids have densities that range from about 0.7\ng/cm3 (the density of gasoline) to 19 g/cm3 (the density of gold).

Quantities derived from\nmeasurements other than counting, however, are uncertain to varying extents due to practical limitations of\nthe measurement process used.\nSignificant Figures in Measurement\nThe numbers of measured quantities, unlike defined or directly counted quantities, are not exact. To measure\nthe volume of liquid in a graduated cylinder, you should make a reading at the bottom of the meniscus, the\nlowest point on the curved surface of the liquid.\nFIGURE 1.26\nTo measure the volume of liquid in this graduated cylinder, you must mentally subdivide the distance\nbetween the 21 and 22 mL marks into tenths of a milliliter, and then make a reading (estimate) at the bottom of the\nmeniscus.\nRefer to the illustration in Figure 1.26. The bottom of the meniscus in this case clearly lies between the 21 and\n22 markings, meaning the liquid volume is certainly greater than 21 mL but less than 22 mL. The meniscus\nappears to be a bit closer to the 22-mL mark than to the 21-mL mark, and so a reasonable estimate of the\nliquid’s volume would be 21.6 mL. In the number 21.6, then, the digits 2 and 1 are certain, but the 6 is an\nestimate. Some people might estimate the meniscus position to be equally distant from each of the markings\nand estimate the tenth-place digit as 5, while others may think it to be even closer to the 22-mL mark and\nestimate this digit to be 7. Note that it would be pointless to attempt to estimate a digit for the hundredths\nplace, given that the tenths-place digit is uncertain. In general, numerical scales such as the one on this\ngraduated cylinder will permit measurements to one-tenth of the smallest scale division. The scale in this case\nhas 1-mL divisions, and so volumes may be measured to the nearest 0.1 mL.\nThis concept holds true for all measurements, even if you do not actively make an estimate. If you place a\nquarter on a standard electronic balance, you may obtain a reading of 6.72 g. The digits 6 and 7 are certain,\nand the 2 indicates that the mass of the quarter is likely between 6.71 and 6.73 grams. The quarter weighs\nabout 6.72 grams, with a nominal uncertainty in the measurement of ± 0.01 gram. If the coin is weighed on a\nmore sensitive balance, the mass might be 6.723 g. This means its mass lies between 6.722 and 6.724 grams,\nan uncertainty of 0.001 gram.

Note that zero may be a measured value; for example, if you stand on\na scale that shows weight to the nearest pound and it shows “120,” then the 1 (hundreds), 2 (tens) and 0 (ones)\nare all significant (measured) values.\nA measurement result is properly reported when its significant digits accurately represent the certainty of the\nmeasurement process. But what if you were analyzing a reported value and trying to determine what is\nsignificant and what is not? Well, for starters, all nonzero digits are significant, and it is only zeros that require\nsome thought. We will use the terms “leading,” “trailing,” and “captive” for the zeros and will consider how to\ndeal with them.\nStarting with the first nonzero digit on the left, count this digit and all remaining digits to the right. This is the\nnumber of significant figures in the measurement unless the last digit is a trailing zero lying to the left of the\ndecimal point.\nCaptive zeros result from measurement and are therefore always significant. Leading zeros, however, are\nnever significant—they merely tell us where the decimal point is located.\nThe leading zeros in this example are not significant. We could use exponential notation (as described in\nAppendix B) and express the number as 8.32407\n10−3; then the number 8.32407 contains all of the\nsignificant figures, and 10−3 locates the decimal point.\nThe number of significant figures is uncertain in a number that ends with a zero to the left of the decimal point\nlocation. The zeros in the measurement 1,300 grams could be significant or they could simply indicate where\nthe decimal point is located. The ambiguity can be resolved with the use of exponential notation: 1.3\n103 (two\nsignificant figures), 1.30\n103 (three significant figures, if the tens place was measured), or 1.300\n103 (four\nsignificant figures, if the ones place was also measured). In cases where only the decimal-formatted number is\navailable, it is prudent to assume that all trailing zeros are not significant.\nWhen determining significant figures, be sure to pay attention to reported values and think about the\nmeasurement and significant figures in terms of what is reasonable or likely when evaluating whether the\n1.5 • Measurement Uncertainty, Accuracy, and Precision\n35",

          "text": "value makes sense. For example, the official January 2014 census reported the resident population of the US\nas 317,297,725. Do you think the US population was correctly determined to the reported nine significant\nfigures, that is, to the exact number of people? People are constantly being born, dying, or moving into or out of\nthe country, and assumptions are made to account for the large number of people who are not actually\ncounted. Because of these uncertainties, it might be more reasonable to expect that we know the population to\nwithin perhaps a million or so, in which case the population should be reported as 3.17\n108 people.\nSignificant Figures in Calculations\nA second important principle of uncertainty is that results calculated from a measurement are at least as\nuncertain as the measurement itself. Take the uncertainty in measurements into account to avoid\nmisrepresenting the uncertainty in calculated results. One way to do this is to report the result of a calculation\nwith the correct number of significant figures, which is determined by the following three rules for rounding\nnumbers:\n1.\nWhen adding or subtracting numbers, round the result to the same number of decimal places as the\nnumber with the least number of decimal places (the least certain value in terms of addition and\nsubtraction).\n2.\nWhen multiplying or dividing numbers, round the result to the same number of digits as the number with\nthe least number of significant figures (the least certain value in terms of multiplication and division).\n3.\nIf the digit to be dropped (the one immediately to the right of the digit to be retained) is less than 5, “round\ndown” and leave the retained digit unchanged; if it is more than 5, “round up” and increase the retained\ndigit by 1. If the dropped digit is 5, and it’s either the last digit in the number or it’s followed only by zeros,\nround up or down, whichever yields an even value for the retained digit. If any nonzero digits follow the\ndropped 5, round up. (The last part of this rule may strike you as a bit odd, but it’s based on reliable\nstatistics and is aimed at avoiding any bias when dropping the digit “5,” since it is equally close to both\npossible values of the retained digit.)\nThe following examples illustrate the application of this rule in rounding a few different numbers to three\nsignificant figures:\n•\n0.028675 rounds “up” to 0.0287 (the dropped digit, 7, is greater than 5)\n•\n18.3384 rounds “down” to 18.3 (the dropped digit, 3, is less than 5)\n•\n6.8752 rounds “up” to 6.88 (the dropped digit is 5, and a nonzero digit follows it)\n•\n92.85 rounds “down” to 92.8 (the dropped digit is 5, and the retained digit is even)\nLet’s work through these rules with a few examples.\nEXAMPLE 1.3\nRounding Numbers\nRound the following to the indicated number of significant figures:\n(a) 31.57 (to two significant figures)\n(b) 8.1649 (to three significant figures)\n(c) 0.051065 (to four significant figures)\n(d) 0.90275 (to four significant figures)\nSolution\n(a) 31.57 rounds “up” to 32 (the dropped digit is 5, and the retained digit is even)\n(b) 8.1649 rounds “down” to 8.16 (the dropped digit, 4, is less than 5)\n(c) 0.051065 rounds “down” to 0.05106 (the dropped digit is 5, and the retained digit is even)\n(d) 0.90275 rounds “up” to 0.9028 (the dropped digit is 5, and the retained digit is even)\n36\n1 • Essential Ideas\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Measurements are said to be precise if they yield\nvery similar results when repeated in the same manner. A measurement is considered accurate if it yields a\nresult that is very close to the true or accepted value. Precise values agree with each other; accurate values\nagree with a true value.

For\nexample, consider measuring the average speed of an athlete running sprints. This is typically accomplished\nby measuring the time required for the athlete to run from the starting line to the finish line, and the distance\nbetween these two lines, and then computing speed from the equation that relates these three properties:\nAn Olympic-quality sprinter can run 100 m in approximately 10 s, corresponding to an average speed of\nNote that this simple arithmetic involves dividing the numbers of each measured quantity to yield the number\nof the computed quantity (100/10 = 10) and likewise dividing the units of each measured quantity to yield the\nunit of the computed quantity (m/s = m/s). Now, consider using this same relation to predict the time required\nfor a person running at this speed to travel a distance of 25 m. The same relation among the three properties is\nused, but in this case, the two quantities provided are a speed (10 m/s) and a distance (25 m). To yield the\nsought property, time, the equation must be rearranged appropriately:\nThe time can then be computed as:\n1.6 • Mathematical Treatment of Measurement Results\n41",

Note that, just as for numbers, when a unit is divided by an\nidentical unit (in this case, m/m), the result is “1”—or, as commonly phrased, the units “cancel.”\nThese calculations are examples of a versatile mathematical approach known as dimensional analysis (or the\nfactor-label method). Dimensional analysis is based on this premise: the units of quantities must be subjected\nto the same mathematical operations as their associated numbers. This method can be applied to\ncomputations ranging from simple unit conversions to more complex, multi-step calculations involving\nseveral different quantities.\nConversion Factors and Dimensional Analysis\nA ratio of two equivalent quantities expressed with different measurement units can be used as a unit\nconversion factor. For example, the lengths of 2.54 cm and 1 in. are equivalent (by definition), and so a unit\nconversion factor may be derived from the ratio,\nSeveral other commonly used conversion factors are given in Table 1.6.\nCommon Conversion Factors\nLength\nVolume\nMass\n1 m = 1.0936 yd\n1 L = 1.0567 qt\n1 kg = 2.2046 lb\n1 in. = 2.54 cm (exact)\n1 qt = 0.94635 L\n1 lb = 453.59 g\n1 km = 0.62137 mi\n1 ft3 = 28.317 L\n1 (avoirdupois) oz = 28.349 g\n1 mi = 1609.3 m\n1 tbsp = 14.787 mL\n1 (troy) oz = 31.103 g\nTABLE 1.6\nWhen a quantity (such as distance in inches) is multiplied by an appropriate unit conversion factor, the\nquantity is converted to an equivalent value with different units (such as distance in centimeters). For\nexample, a basketball player’s vertical jump of 34 inches can be converted to centimeters by:\nSince this simple arithmetic involves quantities, the premise of dimensional analysis requires that we multiply\nboth numbers and units. The numbers of these two quantities are multiplied to yield the number of the\nproduct quantity, 86, whereas the units are multiplied to yield\n. Just as for numbers, a ratio of identical\nunits is also numerically equal to one,\nand the unit product thus simplifies to cm. (When identical\nunits divide to yield a factor of 1, they are said to “cancel.”) Dimensional analysis may be used to confirm the\nproper application of unit conversion factors as demonstrated in the following example.\nEXAMPLE 1.8\nUsing a Unit Conversion Factor\nThe mass of a competition frisbee is 125 g.

Chemists use the\nscientific method to perform experiments, pose\nhypotheses, and formulate laws and develop\ntheories, so that they can better understand the\nbehavior of the natural world. To do so, they operate\nin the macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic\ndomains. Chemists measure, analyze, purify, and\nsynthesize a wide variety of substances that are\nimportant to our lives.\n1.2 Phases and Classification of Matter\nMatter is anything that occupies space and has\nmass. The basic building block of matter is the atom,\nthe smallest unit of an element that can enter into\ncombinations with atoms of the same or other\nelements. In many substances, atoms are combined\ninto molecules. On earth, matter commonly exists in\nthree states: solids, of fixed shape and volume;\nliquids, of variable shape but fixed volume; and\ngases, of variable shape and volume. Under high-\ntemperature conditions, matter also can exist as a\nplasma. Most matter is a mixture: It is composed of\ntwo or more types of matter that can be present in\nvarying amounts and can be separated by physical\nmeans. Heterogeneous mixtures vary in\ncomposition from point to point; homogeneous\nmixtures have the same composition from point to\npoint. Pure substances consist of only one type of\nmatter. A pure substance can be an element, which\nconsists of only one type of atom and cannot be\nbroken down by a chemical change, or a compound,\nwhich consists of two or more types of atoms.\n1.3 Physical and Chemical Properties\nAll substances have distinct physical and chemical\nproperties, and may undergo physical or chemical\nchanges. Physical properties, such as hardness and\nboiling point, and physical changes, such as melting\nor freezing, do not involve a change in the\ncomposition of matter. Chemical properties, such\nflammability and acidity, and chemical changes,\nsuch as rusting, involve production of matter that\ndiffers from that present beforehand.\nMeasurable properties fall into one of two categories.\nExtensive properties depend on the amount of\nmatter present, for example, the mass of gold.\nIntensive properties do not depend on the amount of\nmatter present, for example, the density of gold.\nHeat is an example of an extensive property, and\ntemperature is an example of an intensive property.\n1.4 Measurements\nMeasurements provide quantitative information that\nis critical in studying and practicing chemistry. Each\nmeasurement has an amount, a unit for comparison,\n1 • Key Equations\n49",

Measurements can be\nrepresented in either decimal or scientific notation.\nScientists primarily use SI (International System)\nunits such as meters, seconds, and kilograms, as\nwell as derived units, such as liters (for volume) and\ng/cm3 (for density). In many cases, it is convenient to\nuse prefixes that yield fractional and multiple units,\nsuch as microseconds (10−6 seconds) and megahertz\n(106 hertz), respectively.\n1.5 Measurement Uncertainty, Accuracy,\nand Precision\nQuantities can be defined or measured. Measured\nquantities have an associated uncertainty that is\nrepresented by the number of significant figures in\nthe quantity’s number. The uncertainty of a\ncalculated quantity depends on the uncertainties in\nthe quantities used in the calculation and is\nreflected in how the value is rounded. Quantities are\ncharacterized with regard to accuracy (closeness to a\ntrue or accepted value) and precision (variation\namong replicate measurement results).\n1.6 Mathematical Treatment of\nMeasurement Results\nMeasurements are made using a variety of units. It is\noften useful or necessary to convert a measured\nquantity from one unit into another. These\nconversions are accomplished using unit conversion\nfactors, which are derived by simple applications of\na mathematical approach called the factor-label\nmethod or dimensional analysis. This strategy is\nalso employed to calculate sought quantities using\nmeasured quantities and appropriate mathematical\nrelations.\nExercises\n1.1 Chemistry in Context\n1.

An essential concept underlying this goal\nis that of a molecule’s identity, which is determined by the numbers and types of atoms it contains, and how\nthey are bonded together. This chapter will describe some of the fundamental chemical principles related to\nthe composition of matter, including those central to the concept of molecular identity.\n2.1 Early Ideas in Atomic Theory\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nState the postulates of Dalton’s atomic theory\n•\nUse postulates of Dalton’s atomic theory to explain the laws of definite and multiple proportions\nThe earliest recorded discussion of the basic structure of matter comes from ancient Greek philosophers, the\nscientists of their day. In the fifth century BC, Leucippus and Democritus argued that all matter was composed\nof small, finite particles that they called atomos, a term derived from the Greek word for “indivisible.” They\nthought of atoms as moving particles that differed in shape and size, and which could join together. Later,\nAristotle and others came to the conclusion that matter consisted of various combinations of the four\n“elements”—fire, earth, air, and water—and could be infinitely divided. Interestingly, these philosophers\nthought about atoms and “elements” as philosophical concepts, but apparently never considered performing\nexperiments to test their ideas.\nThe Aristotelian view of the composition of matter held sway for over two thousand years, until English\nschoolteacher John Dalton helped to revolutionize chemistry with his hypothesis that the behavior of matter\ncould be explained using an atomic theory. First published in 1807, many of Dalton’s hypotheses about the\nmicroscopic features of matter are still valid in modern atomic theory. Here are the postulates of Dalton’s\natomic theory.\n1.\nMatter is composed of exceedingly small particles called atoms. An atom is the smallest unit of an element\nthat can participate in a chemical change.\n2.\nAn element consists of only one type of atom, which has a mass that is characteristic of the element and is\nthe same for all atoms of that element (Figure 2.2). A macroscopic sample of an element contains an\nincredibly large number of atoms, all of which have identical chemical properties.\nFIGURE 2.2\nA pre-1982 copper penny (left) contains approximately 3\n1022 copper atoms (several dozen are\nrepresented as brown spheres at the right), each of which has the same chemical properties. (credit:\nmodification of work by “slgckgc”/Flickr)\n3.\nAtoms of one element differ in properties from atoms of all other elements.\n4.\nA compound consists of atoms of two or more elements combined in a small, whole-number ratio. In a\ngiven compound, the numbers of atoms of each of its elements are always present in the same ratio\n(Figure 2.3).\n62\n2 • Atoms, Molecules, and Ions\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

(credit copper: modification of work by http://images-of-\nelements.com/copper.php)\nDalton’s atomic theory provides a microscopic explanation of the many macroscopic properties of matter that\nyou’ve learned about. For example, if an element such as copper consists of only one kind of atom, then it\ncannot be broken down into simpler substances, that is, into substances composed of fewer types of atoms.\nAnd if atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change, then the total mass of matter\npresent when matter changes from one type to another will remain constant (the law of conservation of\nmatter).\nEXAMPLE 2.1\nTesting Dalton’s Atomic Theory\nIn the following drawing, the green spheres represent atoms of a certain element.

The products consist of four\ngreen spheres and two purple spheres. This does not violate any of Dalton’s postulates: Atoms are neither\ncreated nor destroyed, but are redistributed in small, whole-number ratios.\nDalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that all samples of a pure\ncompound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of\ndefinite proportions or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the\nelements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For\nexample, when different samples of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the\noctane rating system) are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as\nshown in Table 2.1.\nConstant Composition of Isooctane\nSample\nCarbon\nHydrogen\nMass Ratio\nA\n14.82 g\n2.78 g\nB\n22.33 g\n4.19 g\nC\n19.40 g\n3.64 g\nTABLE 2.1\nIt is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is\nnot true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For\nexample, there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of\n5.33:1.00.\nDalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another\ninteresting law. The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements react to form more than one\ncompound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole\n64\n2 • Atoms, Molecules, and Ions\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Are they the smallest particles, or is there\nsomething smaller? In the late 1800s, a number of scientists interested in questions like these investigated the\nelectrical discharges that could be produced in low-pressure gases, with the most significant discovery made\nby English physicist J. J. Thomson using a cathode ray tube. This apparatus consisted of a sealed glass tube\nfrom which almost all the air had been removed; the tube contained two metal electrodes. When high voltage\nwas applied across the electrodes, a visible beam called a cathode ray appeared between them. This beam was\ndeflected toward the positive charge and away from the negative charge, and was produced in the same way\nwith identical properties when different metals were used for the electrodes. In similar experiments, the ray\nwas simultaneously deflected by an applied magnetic field, and measurements of the extent of deflection and\nthe magnetic field strength allowed Thomson to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio of the cathode ray particles.\nThe results of these measurements indicated that these particles were much lighter than atoms (Figure 2.6).\n66\n2 • Atoms, Molecules, and Ions\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

(c) In the cathode ray, the beam (shown in yellow) comes from the cathode\nand is accelerated past the anode toward a fluorescent scale at the end of the tube. Simultaneous deflections by\napplied electric and magnetic fields permitted Thomson to calculate the mass-to-charge ratio of the particles\ncomposing the cathode ray. (credit a: modification of work by Nobel Foundation; credit b: modification of work by\nEugen Nesper; credit c: modification of work by “Kurzon”/Wikimedia Commons)\nBased on his observations, here is what Thomson proposed and why: The particles are attracted by positive (+)\ncharges and repelled by negative (−) charges, so they must be negatively charged (like charges repel and unlike\ncharges attract); they are less massive than atoms and indistinguishable, regardless of the source material, so\nthey must be fundamental, subatomic constituents of all atoms. Although controversial at the time, Thomson’s\nidea was gradually accepted, and his cathode ray particle is what we now call an electron, a negatively\ncharged, subatomic particle with a mass more than one thousand-times less that of an atom. The term\n“electron” was coined in 1891 by Irish physicist George Stoney, from “electric ion.”\nLINK TO LEARNING\nClick here (http://openstax.org/l/16JJThomson) to hear Thomson describe his discovery in his own voice.\nIn 1909, more information about the electron was uncovered by American physicist Robert A. Millikan via his\n“oil drop” experiments. Millikan created microscopic oil droplets, which could be electrically charged by\nfriction as they formed or by using X-rays. These droplets initially fell due to gravity, but their downward\nprogress could be slowed or even reversed by an electric field lower in the apparatus. By adjusting the electric\nfield strength and making careful measurements and appropriate calculations, Millikan was able to determine\nthe charge on individual drops (Figure 2.7).\n2.2 • Evolution of Atomic Theory\n67",

The tabulated data are examples of\na few possible values.\nLooking at the charge data that Millikan gathered, you may have recognized that the charge of an oil droplet is\nalways a multiple of a specific charge, 1.6\n10−19 C. Millikan concluded that this value must therefore be a\nfundamental charge—the charge of a single electron—with his measured charges due to an excess of one\nelectron (1 times 1.6\n10−19 C), two electrons (2 times 1.6\n10−19 C), three electrons (3 times 1.6\n10−19 C),\nand so on, on a given oil droplet. Since the charge of an electron was now known due to Millikan’s research,\nand the charge-to-mass ratio was already known due to Thomson’s research (1.759\n1011 C/kg), it only\nrequired a simple calculation to determine the mass of the electron as well.\nScientists had now established that the atom was not indivisible as Dalton had believed, and due to the work of\nThomson, Millikan, and others, the charge and mass of the negative, subatomic particles—the electrons—were\nknown. However, the positively charged part of an atom was not yet well understood. In 1904, Thomson\nproposed the “plum pudding” model of atoms, which described a positively charged mass with an equal\namount of negative charge in the form of electrons embedded in it, since all atoms are electrically neutral. A\ncompeting model had been proposed in 1903 by Hantaro Nagaoka, who postulated a Saturn-like atom,\nconsisting of a positively charged sphere surrounded by a halo of electrons (Figure 2.8).\nFIGURE 2.8\n(a) Thomson suggested that atoms resembled plum pudding, an English dessert consisting of moist\ncake with embedded raisins (“plums”).

He performed a series of experiments\nusing a beam of high-speed, positively charged alpha particles (α particles) that were produced by the\nradioactive decay of radium; α particles consist of two protons and two neutrons (you will learn more about\nradioactive decay in the chapter on nuclear chemistry). Rutherford and his colleagues Hans Geiger (later\nfamous for the Geiger counter) and Ernest Marsden aimed a beam of α particles, the source of which was\nembedded in a lead block to absorb most of the radiation, at a very thin piece of gold foil and examined the\nresultant scattering of the α particles using a luminescent screen that glowed briefly where hit by an α particle.\nWhat did they discover? Most particles passed right through the foil without being deflected at all. However,\nsome were diverted slightly, and a very small number were deflected almost straight back toward the source\n(Figure 2.9). Rutherford described finding these results: “It was quite the most incredible event that has ever\nhappened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper\nand it came back and hit you.”1\nFIGURE 2.9\nGeiger and Rutherford fired α particles at a piece of gold foil and detected where those particles went,\nas shown in this schematic diagram of their experiment. Most of the particles passed straight through the foil, but a\nfew were deflected slightly and a very small number were significantly deflected.\nHere is what Rutherford deduced: Because most of the fast-moving α particles passed through the gold atoms\nundeflected, they must have traveled through essentially empty space inside the atom. Alpha particles are\npositively charged, so deflections arose when they encountered another positive charge (like charges repel\neach other). Since like charges repel one another, the few positively charged α particles that changed paths\nabruptly must have hit, or closely approached, another body that also had a highly concentrated, positive\ncharge. Since the deflections occurred a small fraction of the time, this charge only occupied a small amount of\nthe space in the gold foil.

          "text": "This analysis led Rutherford to propose a model in which an atom consists of a very small, positively charged\nnucleus, in which most of the mass of the atom is concentrated, surrounded by the negatively charged\nelectrons, so that the atom is electrically neutral (Figure 2.10). After many more experiments, Rutherford also\ndiscovered that the nuclei of other elements contain the hydrogen nucleus as a “building block,” and he named\nthis more fundamental particle the proton, the positively charged, subatomic particle found in the nucleus.\nWith one addition, which you will learn next, this nuclear model of the atom, proposed over a century ago, is\nstill used today.\nFIGURE 2.10\nThe α particles are deflected only when they collide with or pass close to the much heavier,\npositively charged gold nucleus. Because the nucleus is very small compared to the size of an atom, very few α\nparticles are deflected. Most pass through the relatively large region occupied by electrons, which are too light to\ndeflect the rapidly moving particles.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe Rutherford Scattering simulation (http://openstax.org/l/16PhetScatter) allows you to investigate the\ndifferences between a “plum pudding” atom and a Rutherford atom by firing α particles at each type of atom.\nAnother important finding was the discovery of isotopes. During the early 1900s, scientists identified several\nsubstances that appeared to be new elements, isolating them from radioactive ores. For example, a “new\nelement” produced by the radioactive decay of thorium was initially given the name mesothorium. However, a\nmore detailed analysis showed that mesothorium was chemically identical to radium (another decay product),\ndespite having a different atomic mass. This result, along with similar findings for other elements, led the\nEnglish chemist Frederick Soddy to realize that an element could have types of atoms with different masses\nthat were chemically indistinguishable. These different types are called isotopes—atoms of the same element\nthat differ in mass. Soddy was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1921 for this discovery.\nOne puzzle remained: The nucleus was known to contain almost all of the mass of an atom, with the number of\nprotons only providing half, or less, of that mass. Different proposals were made to explain what constituted\nthe remaining mass, including the existence of neutral particles in the nucleus. As you might expect, detecting\nuncharged particles is very challenging, and it was not until 1932 that James Chadwick found evidence of\nneutrons, uncharged, subatomic particles with a mass approximately the same as that of protons. The\nexistence of the neutron also explained isotopes: They differ in mass because they have different numbers of\n70\n2 • Atoms, Molecules, and Ions\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

This will be\nexplained in more detail later in this chapter.\n2.3 Atomic Structure and Symbolism\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nWrite and interpret symbols that depict the atomic number, mass number, and charge of an atom or ion\n•\nDefine the atomic mass unit and average atomic mass\n•\nCalculate average atomic mass and isotopic abundance\nThe development of modern atomic theory revealed much about the inner structure of atoms. It was learned\nthat an atom contains a very small nucleus composed of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons,\nsurrounded by a much larger volume of space containing negatively charged electrons. The nucleus contains\nthe majority of an atom’s mass because protons and neutrons are much heavier than electrons, whereas\nelectrons occupy almost all of an atom’s volume. The diameter of an atom is on the order of 10−10 m, whereas\nthe diameter of the nucleus is roughly 10−15 m—about 100,000 times smaller. For a perspective about their\nrelative sizes, consider this: If the nucleus were the size of a blueberry, the atom would be about the size of a\nfootball stadium (Figure 2.11).\nFIGURE 2.11\nIf an atom could be expanded to the size of a football stadium, the nucleus would be the size of a\nsingle blueberry. (credit middle: modification of work by “babyknight”/Wikimedia Commons; credit right:\nmodification of work by Paxson Woelber)\nAtoms—and the protons, neutrons, and electrons that compose them—are extremely small. For example, a\ncarbon atom weighs less than 2\n10−23 g, and an electron has a charge of less than 2\n10−19 C (coulomb).\nWhen describing the properties of tiny objects such as atoms, we use appropriately small units of measure,\nsuch as the atomic mass unit (amu) and the fundamental unit of charge (e). The amu was originally defined\nbased on hydrogen, the lightest element, then later in terms of oxygen. Since 1961, it has been defined with\nregard to the most abundant isotope of carbon, atoms of which are assigned masses of exactly 12 amu. (This\nisotope is known as “carbon-12” as will be discussed later in this module.) Thus, one amu is exactly\nof the\nmass of one carbon-12 atom: 1 amu = 1.6605\n10−24 g. (The Dalton (Da) and the unified atomic mass unit (u)\nare alternative units that are equivalent to the amu.) The fundamental unit of charge (also called the\nelementary charge) equals the magnitude of the charge of an electron (e) with e = 1.602\n10−19 C.\nA proton has a mass of 1.0073 amu and a charge of 1+. A neutron is a slightly heavier particle with a mass\n1.0087 amu and a charge of zero; as its name suggests, it is neutral. The electron has a charge of 1− and is a\nmuch lighter particle with a mass of about 0.00055 amu (it would take about 1800 electrons to equal the mass\nof one proton). The properties of these fundamental particles are summarized in Table 2.2. (An observant\nstudent might notice that the sum of an atom’s subatomic particles does not equal the atom’s actual mass: The\ntotal mass of six protons, six neutrons, and six electrons is 12.0993 amu, slightly larger than 12.00 amu. This\n“missing” mass is known as the mass defect, and you will learn about it in the chapter on nuclear chemistry.)\n2.3 • Atomic Structure and Symbolism\n71",

This is the defining trait of an\nelement: Its value determines the identity of the atom. For example, any atom that contains six protons is the\nelement carbon and has the atomic number 6, regardless of how many neutrons or electrons it may have. A\nneutral atom must contain the same number of positive and negative charges, so the number of protons equals\nthe number of electrons. Therefore, the atomic number also indicates the number of electrons in an atom. The\ntotal number of protons and neutrons in an atom is called its mass number (A). The number of neutrons is\ntherefore the difference between the mass number and the atomic number: A – Z = number of neutrons.\nAtoms are electrically neutral if they contain the same number of positively charged protons and negatively\ncharged electrons. When the numbers of these subatomic particles are not equal, the atom is electrically\ncharged and is called an ion. The charge of an atom is defined as follows:\nAtomic charge = number of protons − number of electrons\nAs will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter, atoms (and molecules) typically acquire charge by\ngaining or losing electrons. An atom that gains one or more electrons will exhibit a negative charge and is\ncalled an anion. Positively charged atoms called cations are formed when an atom loses one or more\nelectrons. For example, a neutral sodium atom (Z = 11) has 11 electrons. If this atom loses one electron, it will\nbecome a cation with a 1+ charge (11 − 10 = 1+). A neutral oxygen atom (Z = 8) has eight electrons, and if it\ngains two electrons it will become an anion with a 2− charge (8 − 10 = 2−).\nEXAMPLE 2.3\nComposition of an Atom\nIodine is an essential trace element in our diet; it is needed to produce thyroid hormone.

Element 109 was named in honor of Lise Meitner, who discovered\nnuclear fission, a phenomenon that would have world-changing impacts; Meitner also contributed to the\ndiscovery of some major isotopes, discussed immediately below.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit this site (http://openstax.org/l/16IUPAC) to learn more about IUPAC, the International Union of Pure and\nApplied Chemistry, and explore its periodic table.\nIsotopes\nThe symbol for a specific isotope of any element is written by placing the mass number as a superscript to the\nleft of the element symbol (Figure 2.14). The atomic number is sometimes written as a subscript preceding the\nsymbol, but since this number defines the element’s identity, as does its symbol, it is often omitted. For\nexample, magnesium exists as a mixture of three isotopes, each with an atomic number of 12 and with mass\nnumbers of 24, 25, and 26, respectively. These isotopes can be identified as 24Mg, 25Mg, and 26Mg. These\nisotope symbols are read as “element, mass number” and can be symbolized consistent with this reading. For\ninstance, 24Mg is read as “magnesium 24,” and can be written as “magnesium-24” or “Mg-24.” 25Mg is read as\n“magnesium 25,” and can be written as “magnesium-25” or “Mg-25.” All magnesium atoms have 12 protons in\ntheir nucleus. They differ only because a 24Mg atom has 12 neutrons in its nucleus, a 25Mg atom has 13\nneutrons, and a 26Mg has 14 neutrons.\nFIGURE 2.14\nThe symbol for an atom indicates the element via its usual two-letter symbol, the mass number as a\nleft superscript, the atomic number as a left subscript (sometimes omitted), and the charge as a right superscript.\nInformation about the naturally occurring isotopes of elements with atomic numbers 1 through 10 is given in\nTable 2.4.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is widely used in chemistry, forensics, medicine,\nenvironmental science, and many other fields to analyze and help identify the substances in a sample of\nmaterial. In a typical mass spectrometer (Figure 2.15), the sample is vaporized and exposed to a high-energy\nelectron beam that causes the sample’s atoms (or molecules) to become electrically charged, typically by losing\none or more electrons. These cations then pass through a (variable) electric or magnetic field that deflects each\ncation’s path to an extent that depends on both its mass and charge (similar to how the path of a large steel ball\nrolling past a magnet is deflected to a lesser extent that that of a small steel ball). The ions are detected, and a\nplot of the relative number of ions generated versus their mass-to-charge ratios (a mass spectrum) is made.\nThe height of each vertical feature or peak in a mass spectrum is proportional to the fraction of cations with\nthe specified mass-to-charge ratio.

The most common form of the\nelement sulfur is composed of molecules that consist of eight atoms of sulfur; its molecular formula is S8\n(Figure 2.17).\nFIGURE 2.17\nA molecule of sulfur is composed of eight sulfur atoms and is therefore written as S8. It can be\nrepresented as (a) a structural formula, (b) a ball-and-stick model, and (c) a space-filling model. Sulfur atoms are\nrepresented by yellow spheres.\nIt is important to note that a subscript following a symbol and a number in front of a symbol do not represent\nthe same thing; for example, H2 and 2H represent distinctly different species. H2 is a molecular formula; it\nrepresents a diatomic molecule of hydrogen, consisting of two atoms of the element that are chemically\nbonded together. The expression 2H, on the other hand, indicates two separate hydrogen atoms that are not\ncombined as a unit. The expression 2H2 represents two molecules of diatomic hydrogen (Figure 2.18).\nFIGURE 2.18\nThe symbols H, 2H, H2, and 2H2 represent very different entities.\n80\n2 • Atoms, Molecules, and Ions\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

We sometimes describe the composition of these compounds with an empirical formula, which indicates\nthe types of atoms present and the simplest whole-number ratio of the number of atoms (or ions) in the\ncompound. For example, titanium dioxide (used as pigment in white paint and in the thick, white, blocking\ntype of sunscreen) has an empirical formula of TiO2. This identifies the elements titanium (Ti) and oxygen (O)\nas the constituents of titanium dioxide, and indicates the presence of twice as many atoms of the element\noxygen as atoms of the element titanium (Figure 2.19).\nFIGURE 2.19\n(a) The white compound titanium dioxide provides effective protection from the sun.

In many cases, the\nmolecular formula of a substance is derived from experimental determination of both its empirical formula\nand its molecular mass (the sum of atomic masses for all atoms composing the molecule). For example, it can\nbe determined experimentally that benzene contains two elements, carbon (C) and hydrogen (H), and that for\nevery carbon atom in benzene, there is one hydrogen atom. Thus, the empirical formula is CH. An\nexperimental determination of the molecular mass reveals that a molecule of benzene contains six carbon\natoms and six hydrogen atoms, so the molecular formula for benzene is C6H6 (Figure 2.20).\nFIGURE 2.20\nBenzene, C6H6, is produced during oil refining and has many industrial uses.

(This is somewhat of an\nacademic exercise; the reverse chronology is generally followed in actual practice.) For example, the molecular\nformula for acetic acid, the component that gives vinegar its sharp taste, is C2H4O2. This formula indicates that\na molecule of acetic acid (Figure 2.21) contains two carbon atoms, four hydrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms.\nThe ratio of atoms is 2:4:2. Dividing by the lowest common denominator (2) gives the simplest, whole-number\nratio of atoms, 1:2:1, so the empirical formula is CH2O.

One such grouping includes lithium (Li),\nsodium (Na), and potassium (K): These elements all are shiny, conduct heat and electricity well, and have\nsimilar chemical properties. A second grouping includes calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), and barium (Ba), which\nalso are shiny, good conductors of heat and electricity, and have chemical properties in common. However, the\nspecific properties of these two groupings are notably different from each other. For example: Li, Na, and K are\nmuch more reactive than are Ca, Sr, and Ba; Li, Na, and K form compounds with oxygen in a ratio of two of their\natoms to one oxygen atom, whereas Ca, Sr, and Ba form compounds with one of their atoms to one oxygen\natom. Fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine (I) also exhibit similar properties to each other, but\nthese properties are drastically different from those of any of the elements above.\n84\n2 • Atoms, Molecules, and Ions\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

          "text": "Dimitri Mendeleev in Russia (1869) and Lothar Meyer in Germany (1870) independently recognized that there\nwas a periodic relationship among the properties of the elements known at that time. Both published tables\nwith the elements arranged according to increasing atomic mass. But Mendeleev went one step further than\nMeyer: He used his table to predict the existence of elements that would have the properties similar to\naluminum and silicon, but were yet unknown. The discoveries of gallium (1875) and germanium (1886)\nprovided great support for Mendeleev’s work. Although Mendeleev and Meyer had a long dispute over priority,\nMendeleev’s contributions to the development of the periodic table are now more widely recognized (Figure\n2.25).\nFIGURE 2.25\n(a) Dimitri Mendeleev is widely credited with creating (b) the first periodic table of the elements.\n(credit a: modification of work by Serge Lachinov; credit b: modification of work by “Den fjättrade ankan”/Wikimedia\nCommons)\nBy the twentieth century, it became apparent that the periodic relationship involved atomic numbers rather\nthan atomic masses. The modern statement of this relationship, the periodic law, is as follows: the properties\nof the elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers. A modern periodic table arranges the\nelements in increasing order of their atomic numbers and groups atoms with similar properties in the same\nvertical column (Figure 2.26). Each box represents an element and contains its atomic number, symbol,\naverage atomic mass, and (sometimes) name. The elements are arranged in seven horizontal rows, called\nperiods or series, and 18 vertical columns, called groups. Groups are labeled at the top of each column. In the\nUnited States, the labels traditionally were numerals with capital letters. However, IUPAC recommends that the\nnumbers 1 through 18 be used, and these labels are more common. For the table to fit on a single page, parts of\ntwo of the rows, a total of 14 columns, are usually written below the main body of the table.\n2.5 • The Periodic Table\n85",

German chemists Ida Tacke and Walter Noddack set out to find the\nelements, a quest being pursued by scientists around the world. Their method was unique in that they did not\nonly consider the properties of manganese, but also the elements horizontally adjacent to the missing\nelements 43 and 75 on the table. Thus, by investigating ores containing minerals of ruthenium (Ru), tungsten\n(W), osmium (Os), and so on, they were able to identify naturally occurring elements that helped complete the\ntable. Rhenium, one of their discoveries, was one of the last natural elements to be discovered and is the last\nstable element to be discovered. (Francium, the last natural element to be discovered, was identified by\nMarguerite Perey in 1939.)\nMany elements differ dramatically in their chemical and physical properties, but some elements are similar in\ntheir behaviors. For example, many elements appear shiny, are malleable (able to be deformed without\nbreaking) and ductile (can be drawn into wires), and conduct heat and electricity well. Other elements are not\nshiny, malleable, or ductile, and are poor conductors of heat and electricity. We can sort the elements into large\nclasses with common properties: metals (elements that are shiny, malleable, good conductors of heat and\nelectricity—shaded yellow); nonmetals (elements that appear dull, poor conductors of heat and\nelectricity—shaded green); and metalloids (elements that conduct heat and electricity moderately well, and\npossess some properties of metals and some properties of nonmetals—shaded purple).\n86\n2 • Atoms, Molecules, and Ions\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

This is partly due to the number of electrons in their outer shell and their similar readiness to bond.\nThese shared properties can have far-ranging implications in nature, science, and medicine. For example,\nwhen Gertrude Elion and George Hitchens were investigating ways to interrupt cell and virus replication to\nfight diseases, they utilized the similarity between sulfur and oxygen (both in Group 16) and their capacity to\nbond in similar ways. Elion focused on purines, which are key components of DNA and which contain oxygen.\nShe found that by introducing sulfur-based compounds (called purine analogues) that mimic the structure of\npurines, molecules within DNA would bond to the analogues rather than the \"regular\" DNA purine. With the\nnormal DNA bonding and structure altered, Elion successfully interrupted cell replication. At its core, the\nstrategy worked because of the similarity between sulfur and oxygen. Her discovery led directly to important\ntreatments for leukemia. Overall, Elion's work with George Hitchens not only led to more treatments, but also\nchanged the entire methodology of drug development. By using specific elements and compounds to target\nspecific aspects of tumor cells, viruses, and bacteria, they laid the groundwork for many of today's most\ncommon and important medicines, used to help millions of people each year. They were awarded the Nobel\nPrize in 1988.\nIn studying the periodic table, you might have noticed something about the atomic masses of some of the\nelements. Element 43 (technetium), element 61 (promethium), and most of the elements with atomic number\n84 (polonium) and higher have their atomic mass given in square brackets. This is done for elements that\nconsist entirely of unstable, radioactive isotopes (you will learn more about radioactivity in the nuclear\nchemistry chapter). An average atomic weight cannot be determined for these elements because their\nradioisotopes may vary significantly in relative abundance, depending on the source, or may not even exist in\nnature. The number in square brackets is the atomic mass number (an approximate atomic mass) of the most\nstable isotope of that element.\n88\n2 • Atoms, Molecules, and Ions\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Electrons, however, can be added to atoms by transfer from other atoms, lost by transfer to other\natoms, or shared with other atoms. The transfer and sharing of electrons among atoms govern the chemistry of\nthe elements. During the formation of some compounds, atoms gain or lose electrons, and form electrically\ncharged particles called ions (Figure 2.28).\nFIGURE 2.28\n(a) A sodium atom (Na) has equal numbers of protons and electrons (11) and is uncharged. (b) A\nsodium cation (Na+) has lost an electron, so it has one more proton (11) than electrons (10), giving it an overall\npositive charge, signified by a superscripted plus sign.\nYou can use the periodic table to predict whether an atom will form an anion or a cation, and you can often\npredict the charge of the resulting ion. Atoms of many main-group metals lose enough electrons to leave them\nwith the same number of electrons as an atom of the preceding noble gas. To illustrate, an atom of an alkali\nmetal (group 1) loses one electron and forms a cation with a 1+ charge; an alkaline earth metal (group 2) loses\ntwo electrons and forms a cation with a 2+ charge, and so on. For example, a neutral calcium atom, with 20\nprotons and 20 electrons, readily loses two electrons. This results in a cation with 20 protons, 18 electrons, and\na 2+ charge. It has the same number of electrons as atoms of the preceding noble gas, argon, and is symbolized\nCa2+. The name of a metal ion is the same as the name of the metal atom from which it forms, so Ca2+ is called\na calcium ion.\nWhen atoms of nonmetal elements form ions, they generally gain enough electrons to give them the same\nnumber of electrons as an atom of the next noble gas in the periodic table. Atoms of group 17 gain one electron\nand form anions with a 1− charge; atoms of group 16 gain two electrons and form ions with a 2− charge, and so\non. For example, the neutral bromine atom, with 35 protons and 35 electrons, can gain one electron to provide\nit with 36 electrons. This results in an anion with 35 protons, 36 electrons, and a 1− charge. It has the same\nnumber of electrons as atoms of the next noble gas, krypton, and is symbolized Br−. (A discussion of the theory\nsupporting the favored status of noble gas electron numbers reflected in these predictive rules for ion\nformation is provided in a later chapter of this text.)\nNote the usefulness of the periodic table in predicting likely ion formation and charge (Figure 2.29). Moving\nfrom the far left to the right on the periodic table, main-group elements tend to form cations with a charge\nequal to the group number. That is, group 1 elements form 1+ ions; group 2 elements form 2+ ions, and so on.\nMoving from the far right to the left on the periodic table, elements often form anions with a negative charge\n2.6 • Ionic and Molecular Compounds\n89",

In fact, transition metals and some other metals often exhibit variable charges that are not\npredictable by their location in the table.

When electrons are transferred and ions form, ionic bonds result. Ionic bonds\nare electrostatic forces of attraction, that is, the attractive forces experienced between objects of opposite\nelectrical charge (in this case, cations and anions). When electrons are “shared” and molecules form, covalent\nbonds result. Covalent bonds are the attractive forces between the positively charged nuclei of the bonded\natoms and one or more pairs of electrons that are located between the atoms. Compounds are classified as\nionic or molecular (covalent) on the basis of the bonds present in them.\n92\n2 • Atoms, Molecules, and Ions\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

          "text": "Ionic Compounds\nWhen an element composed of atoms that readily lose electrons (a metal) reacts with an element composed of\natoms that readily gain electrons (a nonmetal), a transfer of electrons usually occurs, producing ions. The\ncompound formed by this transfer is stabilized by the electrostatic attractions (ionic bonds) between the ions\nof opposite charge present in the compound. For example, when each sodium atom in a sample of sodium\nmetal (group 1) gives up one electron to form a sodium cation, Na+, and each chlorine atom in a sample of\nchlorine gas (group 17) accepts one electron to form a chloride anion, Cl−, the resulting compound, NaCl, is\ncomposed of sodium ions and chloride ions in the ratio of one Na+ ion for each Cl−ion. Similarly, each calcium\natom (group 2) can give up two electrons and transfer one to each of two chlorine atoms to form CaCl2, which is\ncomposed of Ca2+ and Cl−ions in the ratio of one Ca2+ ion to two Cl−ions.\nA compound that contains ions and is held together by ionic bonds is called an ionic compound. The periodic\ntable can help us recognize many of the compounds that are ionic: When a metal is combined with one or more\nnonmetals, the compound is usually ionic. This guideline works well for predicting ionic compound formation\nfor most of the compounds typically encountered in an introductory chemistry course. However, it is not\nalways true (for example, aluminum chloride, AlCl3, is not ionic).\nYou can often recognize ionic compounds because of their properties. Ionic compounds are solids that\ntypically melt at high temperatures and boil at even higher temperatures. For example, sodium chloride melts\nat 801 °C and boils at 1413 °C. (As a comparison, the molecular compound water melts at 0 °C and boils at 100\n°C.) In solid form, an ionic compound is not electrically conductive because its ions are unable to flow\n(“electricity” is the flow of charged particles). When molten, however, it can conduct electricity because its ions\nare able to move freely through the liquid (Figure 2.30).\nFIGURE 2.30\nSodium chloride melts at 801 °C and conducts electricity when molten. (credit: modification of work\nby Mark Blaser and Matt Evans)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/16moltensalt) to see a mixture of salts melt and conduct electricity.\nIn every ionic compound, the total number of positive charges of the cations equals the total number of\nnegative charges of the anions. Thus, ionic compounds are electrically neutral overall, even though they\ncontain positive and negative ions. We can use this observation to help us write the formula of an ionic\ncompound. The formula of an ionic compound must have a ratio of ions such that the numbers of positive and\nnegative charges are equal.\nEXAMPLE 2.10\nPredicting the Formula of an Ionic Compound\nThe gemstone sapphire (Figure 2.31) is mostly a compound of aluminum and oxygen that contains aluminum\n2.6 • Ionic and Molecular Compounds\n93",

Two aluminum ions, each with a charge of 3+, would give us six positive charges, and three\noxide ions, each with a charge of 2−, would give us six negative charges.

As with simple\nionic compounds, these compounds must also be electrically neutral, so their formulas can be predicted by\ntreating the polyatomic ions as discrete units. We use parentheses in a formula to indicate a group of atoms\nthat behave as a unit. For example, the formula for calcium phosphate, one of the minerals in our bones, is\nCa3(PO4)2. This formula indicates that there are three calcium ions (Ca2+) for every two phosphate\ngroups. The\ngroups are discrete units, each consisting of one phosphorus atom and four oxygen atoms,\nand having an overall charge of 3−. The compound is electrically neutral, and its formula shows a total count of\nthree Ca, two P, and eight O atoms.\nEXAMPLE 2.11\nPredicting the Formula of a Compound with a Polyatomic Anion\nBaking powder contains calcium dihydrogen phosphate, an ionic compound composed of the ions Ca2+ and\nWhat is the formula of this compound?\nSolution\nThe positive and negative charges must balance, and this ionic compound must be electrically neutral. Thus,\nwe must have two negative charges to balance the 2+ charge of the calcium ion. This requires a ratio of one\nCa2+ ion to two\nions. We designate this by enclosing the formula for the dihydrogen phosphate ion in\nparentheses and adding a subscript 2.

The simplest of these are binary compounds, those containing only two elements, but\nwe will also consider how to name ionic compounds containing polyatomic ions, and one specific, very\nimportant class of compounds known as acids (subsequent chapters in this text will focus on these compounds\nin great detail). We will limit our attention here to inorganic compounds, compounds that are composed\nprincipally of elements other than carbon, and will follow the nomenclature guidelines proposed by IUPAC.\nThe rules for organic compounds, in which carbon is the principle element, will be treated in a later chapter on\norganic chemistry.\nIonic Compounds\nTo name an inorganic compound, we need to consider the answers to several questions. First, is the compound\nionic or molecular? If the compound is ionic, does the metal form ions of only one type (fixed charge) or more\nthan one type (variable charge)? Are the ions monatomic or polyatomic? If the compound is molecular, does it\ncontain hydrogen? If so, does it also contain oxygen? From the answers we derive, we place the compound in\nan appropriate category and then name it accordingly.\nCompounds Containing Only Monatomic Ions\nThe name of a binary compound containing monatomic ions consists of the name of the cation (the name of\nthe metal) followed by the name of the anion (the name of the nonmetallic element with its ending replaced by\nthe suffix –ide).

Compounds of these metals with nonmetals are named with the same method as compounds in the\nfirst category, except the charge of the metal ion is specified by a Roman numeral in parentheses after the\nname of the metal. The charge of the metal ion is determined from the formula of the compound and the\ncharge of the anion. For example, consider binary ionic compounds of iron and chlorine. Iron typically exhibits\na charge of either 2+ or 3+ (see Figure 2.29), and the two corresponding compound formulas are FeCl2 and\nFeCl3. The simplest name, “iron chloride,” will, in this case, be ambiguous, as it does not distinguish between\nthese two compounds. In cases like this, the charge of the metal ion is included as a Roman numeral in\nparentheses immediately following the metal name.

Her investigation eventually linked the illnesses to groundwater\ncontaminated by Cr(VI) used by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) to fight corrosion in a nearby natural gas\npipeline. As dramatized in the film Erin Brockovich (for which Julia Roberts won an Oscar), Erin and lawyer\nEdward Masry sued PG&E for contaminating the water near Hinckley in 1993. The settlement they won in\n1996—$333 million—was the largest amount ever awarded for a direct-action lawsuit in the US at that time.\nFIGURE 2.32\n(a) Erin Brockovich found that Cr(VI), used by PG&E, had contaminated the Hinckley, California,\nwater supply. (b) The Cr(VI) ion is often present in water as the polyatomic ions chromate,\n(left), and\ndichromate,\n(right).\nChromium compounds are widely used in industry, such as for chrome plating, in dye-making, as\npreservatives, and to prevent corrosion in cooling tower water, as occurred near Hinckley. In the\nenvironment, chromium exists primarily in either the Cr(III) or Cr(VI) forms. Cr(III), an ingredient of many\nvitamin and nutritional supplements, forms compounds that are not very soluble in water, and it has low\ntoxicity. But Cr(VI) is much more toxic and forms compounds that are reasonably soluble in water.\nExposure to small amounts of Cr(VI) can lead to damage of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and immune\nsystems, as well as the kidneys, liver, blood, and skin.\nDespite cleanup efforts, Cr(VI) groundwater contamination remains a problem in Hinckley and other\nlocations across the globe. A 2010 study by the Environmental Working Group found that of 35 US cities\ntested, 31 had higher levels of Cr(VI) in their tap water than the public health goal of 0.02 parts per billion\nset by the California Environmental Protection Agency.\n100\n2 • Atoms, Molecules, and Ions\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

The charges of cations and anions dictate their ratios in ionic\ncompounds, so specifying the names of the ions provides sufficient information to determine chemical\nformulas. However, because covalent bonding allows for significant variation in the combination ratios of the\natoms in a molecule, the names for molecular compounds must explicitly identify these ratios.\nCompounds Composed of Two Elements\nWhen two nonmetallic elements form a molecular compound, several combination ratios are often possible.\nFor example, carbon and oxygen can form the compounds CO and CO2. Since these are different substances\nwith different properties, they cannot both have the same name (they cannot both be called carbon oxide).

Dalton\npostulated that each element has a characteristic\ntype of atom that differs in properties from atoms of\nall other elements, and that atoms of different\nelements can combine in fixed, small, whole-\nnumber ratios to form compounds. Samples of a\nparticular compound all have the same elemental\nproportions by mass. When two elements form\ndifferent compounds, a given mass of one element\nwill combine with masses of the other element in a\nsmall, whole-number ratio. During any chemical\nchange, atoms are neither created nor destroyed.\n2.2 Evolution of Atomic Theory\nAlthough no one has actually seen the inside of an\natom, experiments have demonstrated much about\natomic structure. Thomson’s cathode ray tube\nshowed that atoms contain small, negatively\ncharged particles called electrons. Millikan\ndiscovered that there is a fundamental electric\ncharge—the charge of an electron. Rutherford’s gold\nfoil experiment showed that atoms have a small,\ndense, positively charged nucleus; the positively\ncharged particles within the nucleus are called\nprotons. Chadwick discovered that the nucleus also\ncontains neutral particles called neutrons. Soddy\ndemonstrated that atoms of the same element can\ndiffer in mass; these are called isotopes.\n2.3 Atomic Structure and Symbolism\nAn atom consists of a small, positively charged\nnucleus surrounded by electrons. The nucleus\ncontains protons and neutrons; its diameter is about\n100,000 times smaller than that of the atom. The\nmass of one atom is usually expressed in atomic\nmass units (amu), which is referred to as the atomic\nmass. An amu is defined as exactly\nof the mass of\na carbon-12 atom and is equal to 1.6605\n10−24 g.\nProtons are relatively heavy particles with a charge\nof 1+ and a mass of 1.0073 amu. Neutrons are\nrelatively heavy particles with no charge and a mass\nof 1.0087 amu. Electrons are light particles with a\ncharge of 1− and a mass of 0.00055 amu. The\nnumber of protons in the nucleus is called the\natomic number (Z) and is the property that defines\nan atom’s elemental identity. The sum of the\n2 • Key Equations\n105",

          "text": "numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is\ncalled the mass number and, expressed in amu, is\napproximately equal to the mass of the atom. An\natom is neutral when it contains equal numbers of\nelectrons and protons.\nIsotopes of an element are atoms with the same\natomic number but different mass numbers;\nisotopes of an element, therefore, differ from each\nother only in the number of neutrons within the\nnucleus. When a naturally occurring element is\ncomposed of several isotopes, the atomic mass of the\nelement represents the average of the masses of the\nisotopes involved. A chemical symbol identifies the\natoms in a substance using symbols, which are one-,\ntwo-, or three-letter abbreviations for the atoms.\n2.4 Chemical Formulas\nA molecular formula uses chemical symbols and\nsubscripts to indicate the exact numbers of different\natoms in a molecule or compound. An empirical\nformula gives the simplest, whole-number ratio of\natoms in a compound. A structural formula\nindicates the bonding arrangement of the atoms in\nthe molecule. Ball-and-stick and space-filling\nmodels show the geometric arrangement of atoms in\na molecule. Isomers are compounds with the same\nmolecular formula but different arrangements of\natoms.\n2.5 The Periodic Table\nThe discovery of the periodic recurrence of similar\nproperties among the elements led to the\nformulation of the periodic table, in which the\nelements are arranged in order of increasing atomic\nnumber in rows known as periods and columns\nknown as groups. Elements in the same group of the\nperiodic table have similar chemical properties.\nElements can be classified as metals, metalloids,\nand nonmetals, or as a main-group elements,\ntransition metals, and inner transition metals.\nGroups are numbered 1–18 from left to right. The\nelements in group 1 are known as the alkali metals;\nthose in group 2 are the alkaline earth metals; those\nin 15 are the pnictogens; those in 16 are the\nchalcogens; those in 17 are the halogens; and those\nin 18 are the noble gases.\n2.6 Ionic and Molecular Compounds\nMetals (particularly those in groups 1 and 2) tend to\nlose the number of electrons that would leave them\nwith the same number of electrons as in the\npreceding noble gas in the periodic table. By this\nmeans, a positively charged ion is formed. Similarly,\nnonmetals (especially those in groups 16 and 17,\nand, to a lesser extent, those in Group 15) can gain\nthe number of electrons needed to provide atoms\nwith the same number of electrons as in the next\nnoble gas in the periodic table. Thus, nonmetals\ntend to form negative ions. Positively charged ions\nare called cations, and negatively charged ions are\ncalled anions. Ions can be either monatomic\n(containing only one atom) or polyatomic\n(containing more than one atom).\nCompounds that contain ions are called ionic\ncompounds. Ionic compounds generally form from\nmetals and nonmetals. Compounds that do not\ncontain ions, but instead consist of atoms bonded\ntightly together in molecules (uncharged groups of\natoms that behave as a single unit), are called\ncovalent compounds. Covalent compounds usually\nform from two nonmetals.\n2.7 Chemical Nomenclature\nChemists use nomenclature rules to clearly name\ncompounds. Ionic and molecular compounds are\nnamed using somewhat-different methods. Binary\nionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first,\nfollowed by the name of the nonmetal with its\nending changed to –ide. For example, K2O is called\npotassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with\ndifferent charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses\nfollows the name of the metal to specify its charge.\nThus, FeCl2 is iron(II) chloride and FeCl3 is iron(III)\nchloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions;\nthe names of common polyatomic ions should be\nmemorized. Molecular compounds can form\ncompounds with different ratios of their elements,\nso prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms\nof each element in a molecule of the compound.\nExamples include SF6, sulfur hexafluoride, and\nN2O4, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important\nclass of compounds containing hydrogen and having\nspecial nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named\nusing the prefix hydro-, changing the –ide suffix to\n–ic, and adding “acid;” HCl is hydrochloric acid.\nOxyacids are named by changing the ending of the\nanion (–ate to –ic and –ite to –ous), and adding\n“acid;” H2CO3 is carbonic acid.\n106\n2 • Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Since it is impractical to refill large pools with fresh water on a frequent basis, pool water is regularly\ntreated with chemicals to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria and algae. Proper pool maintenance requires\nregular additions of various chemical compounds in carefully measured amounts. For example, the relative\namount of calcium ion, Ca2+, in the water should be maintained within certain limits to prevent eye irritation\nand avoid damage to the pool bed and plumbing. To maintain proper calcium levels, calcium cations are added\nto the water in the form of an ionic compound that also contains anions; thus, it is necessary to know both the\nrelative amount of Ca2+ in the compound and the volume of water in the pool in order to achieve the proper\ncalcium level. Quantitative aspects of the composition of substances (such as the calcium-containing\ncompound) and mixtures (such as the pool water) are the subject of this chapter.\nFigure 3.1\nThe water in a swimming pool is a complex mixture of substances whose relative amounts must be\ncarefully maintained to ensure the health and comfort of people using the pool.

For example, Dalton’s atomic theory was an attempt to explain the results\nof measurements that allowed him to calculate the relative masses of elements combined in various\ncompounds. Understanding the relationship between the masses of atoms and the chemical formulas of\ncompounds allows us to quantitatively describe the composition of substances.\nFormula Mass\nAn earlier chapter of this text described the development of the atomic mass unit, the concept of average\natomic masses, and the use of chemical formulas to represent the elemental makeup of substances. These\nideas can be extended to calculate the formula mass of a substance by summing the average atomic masses of\nall the atoms represented in the substance’s formula.\nFormula Mass for Covalent Substances\nFor covalent substances, the formula represents the numbers and types of atoms composing a single molecule\nof the substance; therefore, the formula mass may be correctly referred to as a molecular mass. Consider\nchloroform (CHCl3), a covalent compound once used as a surgical anesthetic and now primarily used in the\nproduction of tetrafluoroethylene, the building block for the \"anti-stick\" polymer, Teflon. The molecular\nformula of chloroform indicates that a single molecule contains one carbon atom, one hydrogen atom, and\nthree chlorine atoms. The average molecular mass of a chloroform molecule is therefore equal to the sum of\nthe average atomic masses of these atoms. Figure 3.2 outlines the calculations used to derive the molecular\nmass of chloroform, which is 119.37 amu.\nFIGURE 3.2\nThe average mass of a chloroform molecule, CHCl3, is 119.37 amu, which is the sum of the average\natomic masses of each of its constituent atoms. The model shows the molecular structure of chloroform.\nLikewise, the molecular mass of an aspirin molecule, C9H8O4, is the sum of the atomic masses of nine carbon\natoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and four oxygen atoms, which amounts to 180.15 amu (Figure 3.3).\n118\n3 • Composition of Substances and Solutions\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

The formula mass for an ionic compound is calculated in the same way as the formula mass for\ncovalent compounds: by summing the average atomic masses of all the atoms in the compound’s formula.\nKeep in mind, however, that the formula for an ionic compound does not represent the composition of a\ndiscrete molecule, so it may not correctly be referred to as the “molecular mass.”\nAs an example, consider sodium chloride, NaCl, the chemical name for common table salt. Sodium chloride is\nan ionic compound composed of sodium cations, Na+, and chloride anions, Cl−, combined in a 1:1 ratio. The\nformula mass for this compound is computed as 58.44 amu (see Figure 3.4).\n3.1 • Formula Mass and the Mole Concept\n119",

Its formula\nmass is 58.44 amu.\nNote that the average masses of neutral sodium and chlorine atoms were used in this computation, rather than\nthe masses for sodium cations and chlorine anions. This approach is perfectly acceptable when computing the\nformula mass of an ionic compound. Even though a sodium cation has a slightly smaller mass than a sodium\natom (since it is missing an electron), this difference will be offset by the fact that a chloride anion is slightly\nmore massive than a chloride atom (due to the extra electron). Moreover, the mass of an electron is negligibly\nsmall with respect to the mass of a typical atom. Even when calculating the mass of an isolated ion, the missing\nor additional electrons can generally be ignored, since their contribution to the overall mass is negligible,\nreflected only in the nonsignificant digits that will be lost when the computed mass is properly rounded. The\nfew exceptions to this guideline are very light ions derived from elements with precisely known atomic\nmasses.\nEXAMPLE 3.2\nComputing Formula Mass for an Ionic Compound\nAluminum sulfate, Al2(SO4)3, is an ionic compound that is used in the manufacture of paper and in various\nwater purification processes.

Today, sophisticated instruments allow the direct measurement\nof these defining microscopic traits; however, the same traits were originally derived from the measurement of\nmacroscopic properties (the masses and volumes of bulk quantities of matter) using relatively simple tools\n(balances and volumetric glassware). This experimental approach required the introduction of a new unit for\namount of substances, the mole, which remains indispensable in modern chemical science.\nThe mole is an amount unit similar to familiar units like pair, dozen, gross, etc. It provides a specific measure\nof the number of atoms or molecules in a sample of matter. One Latin connotation for the word “mole” is “large\nmass” or “bulk,” which is consistent with its use as the name for this unit. The mole provides a link between an\neasily measured macroscopic property, bulk mass, and an extremely important fundamental property,\nnumber of atoms, molecules, and so forth. A mole of substance is that amount in which there are 6.02214076\n1023 discrete entities (atoms or molecules). This large number is a fundamental constant known as\nAvogadro’s number (NA) or the Avogadro constant in honor of Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro. This\nconstant is properly reported with an explicit unit of “per mole,” a conveniently rounded version being 6.022\n1023/mol.\nConsistent with its definition as an amount unit, 1 mole of any element contains the same number of atoms as\n1 mole of any other element. The masses of 1 mole of different elements, however, are different, since the\nmasses of the individual atoms are drastically different. The molar mass of an element (or compound) is the\nmass in grams of 1 mole of that substance, a property expressed in units of grams per mole (g/mol) (see Figure\n3.5).\nFIGURE 3.5\nEach sample contains 6.022\n1023 atoms —1.00 mol of atoms. From left to right (top row): 65.4 g\nzinc, 12.0 g carbon, 24.3 g magnesium, and 63.5 g copper. From left to right (bottom row): 32.1 g sulfur, 28.1 g\nsilicon, 207 g lead, and 118.7 g tin. (credit: modification of work by Mark Ott)\nThe molar mass of any substance is numerically equivalent to its atomic or formula weight in amu. Per the\namu definition, a single 12C atom weighs 12 amu (its atomic mass is 12 amu). A mole of 12C weighs 12 g (its\nmolar mass is 12 g/mol). This relationship holds for all elements, since their atomic masses are measured\nrelative to that of the amu-reference substance, 12C. Extending this principle, the molar mass of a compound in\ngrams is likewise numerically equivalent to its formula mass in amu (Figure 3.6).\n3.1 • Formula Mass and the Mole Concept\n121",

Great progress has been made in brain research over the past few decades, and the BRAIN Initiative, a\nfederal initiative announced in 2013, aims to accelerate and capitalize on these advances through the\nconcerted efforts of various industrial, academic, and government agencies (more details available at\nwww.whitehouse.gov/share/brain-initiative).\nFIGURE 3.9\n(a) A typical human brain weighs about 1.5 kg and occupies a volume of roughly 1.1 L. (b) Information\nis transmitted in brain tissue and throughout the central nervous system by specialized cells called neurons\n(micrograph shows cells at 1600× magnification).\nSpecialized cells called neurons transmit information between different parts of the central nervous system by\nway of electrical and chemical signals. Chemical signaling occurs at the interface between different neurons\nwhen one of the cells releases molecules (called neurotransmitters) that diffuse across the small gap between\nthe cells (called the synapse) and bind to the surface of the other cell. These neurotransmitter molecules are\nstored in small intracellular structures called vesicles that fuse to the cell membrane and then break open to\nrelease their contents when the neuron is appropriately stimulated. This process is called exocytosis (see\nFigure 3.10). One neurotransmitter that has been very extensively studied is dopamine, C8H11NO2. Dopamine\nis involved in various neurological processes that impact a wide variety of human behaviors. Dysfunctions in\nthe dopamine systems of the brain underlie serious neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s and\nschizophrenia.\nFIGURE 3.10\n(a) Chemical signals are transmitted from neurons to other cells by the release of neurotransmitter\nmolecules into the small gaps (synapses) between the cells.

          "text": "One important aspect of the complex processes related to dopamine signaling is the number of\nneurotransmitter molecules released during exocytosis. Since this number is a central factor in determining\nneurological response (and subsequent human thought and action), it is important to know how this number\nchanges with certain controlled stimulations, such as the administration of drugs. It is also important to\nunderstand the mechanism responsible for any changes in the number of neurotransmitter molecules\nreleased—for example, some dysfunction in exocytosis, a change in the number of vesicles in the neuron, or a\nchange in the number of neurotransmitter molecules in each vesicle.\nSignificant progress has been made recently in directly measuring the number of dopamine molecules stored\nin individual vesicles and the amount actually released when the vesicle undergoes exocytosis. Using\nminiaturized probes that can selectively detect dopamine molecules in very small amounts, scientists have\ndetermined that the vesicles of a certain type of mouse brain neuron contain an average of 30,000 dopamine\nmolecules per vesicle (about\nmol or 50 zmol). Analysis of these neurons from mice subjected to\nvarious drug therapies shows significant changes in the average number of dopamine molecules contained in\nindividual vesicles, increasing or decreasing by up to three-fold, depending on the specific drug used. These\nstudies also indicate that not all of the dopamine in a given vesicle is released during exocytosis, suggesting\nthat it may be possible to regulate the fraction released using pharmaceutical therapies.1\n3.2 Determining Empirical and Molecular Formulas\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nCompute the percent composition of a compound\n•\nDetermine the empirical formula of a compound\n•\nDetermine the molecular formula of a compound\nThe previous section discussed the relationship between the bulk mass of a substance and the number of\natoms or molecules it contains (moles). Given the chemical formula of the substance, one may determine the\namount of the substance (moles) from its mass, and vice versa. But what if the chemical formula of a substance\nis unknown? In this section, these same principles will be applied to derive the chemical formulas of unknown\nsubstances from experimental mass measurements.\nPercent Composition\nThe elemental makeup of a compound defines its chemical identity, and chemical formulas are the most\nsuccinct way of representing this elemental makeup. When a compound’s formula is unknown, measuring the\nmass of each of its constituent elements is often the first step in the process of determining the formula\nexperimentally. The results of these measurements permit the calculation of the compound’s percent\ncomposition, defined as the percentage by mass of each element in the compound. For example, consider a\ngaseous compound composed solely of carbon and hydrogen. The percent composition of this compound\ncould be represented as follows:\nIf analysis of a 10.0-g sample of this gas showed it to contain 2.5 g H and 7.5 g C, the percent composition\nwould be calculated to be 25% H and 75% C:\n1\nOmiatek, Donna M., Amanda J.

As one example, consider the common nitrogen-containing fertilizers\nammonia (NH3), ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), and urea (CH4N2O). The element nitrogen is the active\ningredient for agricultural purposes, so the mass percentage of nitrogen in the compound is a practical and\neconomic concern for consumers choosing among these fertilizers. For these sorts of applications, the percent\ncomposition of a compound is easily derived from its formula mass and the atomic masses of its constituent\nelements. A molecule of NH3 contains one N atom weighing 14.01 amu and three H atoms weighing a total of (3\n1.008 amu) = 3.024 amu. The formula mass of ammonia is therefore (14.01 amu + 3.024 amu) = 17.03 amu,\nand its percent composition is:\nThis same approach may be taken considering a pair of molecules, a dozen molecules, or a mole of molecules,\netc. The latter amount is most convenient and would simply involve the use of molar masses instead of atomic\nand formula masses, as demonstrated Example 3.10.

These quantities may be\ndetermined experimentally by various measurement techniques. Molecular mass, for example, is often\nderived from the mass spectrum of the compound (see discussion of this technique in the previous chapter on\natoms and molecules). Molar mass can be measured by a number of experimental methods, many of which\nwill be introduced in later chapters of this text.\nMolecular formulas are derived by comparing the compound’s molecular or molar mass to its empirical\nformula mass. As the name suggests, an empirical formula mass is the sum of the average atomic masses of all\nthe atoms represented in an empirical formula. If the molecular (or molar) mass of the substance is known, it\nmay be divided by the empirical formula mass to yield the number of empirical formula units per molecule (n):\nThe molecular formula is then obtained by multiplying each subscript in the empirical formula by n, as shown\nby the generic empirical formula AxBy:\nFor example, consider a covalent compound whose empirical formula is determined to be CH2O. The empirical\nformula mass for this compound is approximately 30 amu (the sum of 12 amu for one C atom, 2 amu for two H\natoms, and 16 amu for one O atom). If the compound’s molecular mass is determined to be 180 amu, this\nindicates that molecules of this compound contain six times the number of atoms represented in the empirical\nformula:\nMolecules of this compound are then represented by molecular formulas whose subscripts are six times\ngreater than those in the empirical formula:\nNote that this same approach may be used when the molar mass (g/mol) instead of the molecular mass (amu)\nis used.

Solutions occur frequently in\nnature and have also been implemented in many forms of manmade technology. A more thorough treatment\nof solution properties is provided in the chapter on solutions and colloids, but provided here is an introduction\nto some of the basic properties of solutions.\nThe relative amount of a given solution component is known as its concentration. Often, though not always, a\nsolution contains one component with a concentration that is significantly greater than that of all other\ncomponents.

For\nexample, a glass of iced tea becomes increasingly diluted as the ice melts. The water from the melting ice\nincreases the volume of the solvent (water) and the overall volume of the solution (iced tea), thereby reducing\nthe relative concentrations of the solutes that give the beverage its taste (Figure 3.16).\nFIGURE 3.16\nBoth solutions contain the same mass of copper nitrate. The solution on the right is more dilute\nbecause the copper nitrate is dissolved in more solvent. (credit: Mark Ott)\nDilution is also a common means of preparing solutions of a desired concentration. By adding solvent to a\nmeasured portion of a more concentrated stock solution, a solution of lesser concentration may be prepared.\nFor example, commercial pesticides are typically sold as solutions in which the active ingredients are far more\nconcentrated than is appropriate for their application. Before they can be used on crops, the pesticides must\nbe diluted. This is also a very common practice for the preparation of a number of common laboratory\nreagents.\nA simple mathematical relationship can be used to relate the volumes and concentrations of a solution before\nand after the dilution process. According to the definition of molarity, the number of moles of solute in a\nsolution (n) is equal to the product of the solution’s molarity (M) and its volume in liters (L):\nExpressions like these may be written for a solution before and after it is diluted:\nwhere the subscripts “1” and “2” refer to the solution before and after the dilution, respectively. Since the\ndilution process does not change the amount of solute in the solution, n1 = n2. Thus, these two equations may\nbe set equal to one another:\nThis relation is commonly referred to as the dilution equation.

However, molarity is only one measure of concentration. This section will describe some other units\nof concentration that are commonly used in various applications, either for convenience or by convention.\nMass Percentage\nEarlier in this chapter, percent composition was introduced as a measure of the relative amount of a given\nelement in a compound. Percentages are also commonly used to express the composition of mixtures,\nincluding solutions. The mass percentage of a solution component is defined as the ratio of the component’s\nmass to the solution’s mass, expressed as a percentage:\nMass percentage is also referred to by similar names such as percent mass, percent weight, weight/weight\npercent, and other variations on this theme. The most common symbol for mass percentage is simply the\npercent sign, %, although more detailed symbols are often used including %mass, %weight, and (w/w)%. Use\nof these more detailed symbols can prevent confusion of mass percentages with other types of percentages,\nsuch as volume percentages (to be discussed later in this section).\nMass percentages are popular concentration units for consumer products. The label of a typical liquid bleach\nbottle (Figure 3.17) cites the concentration of its active ingredient, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), as being\n7.4%. A 100.0-g sample of bleach would therefore contain 7.4 g of NaOCl.\nFIGURE 3.17\nLiquid bleach is an aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl).

What is the percent by mass of glucose\nin spinal fluid?\nSolution\nThe spinal fluid sample contains roughly 4 mg of glucose in 5000 mg of fluid, so the mass fraction of glucose\nshould be a bit less than one part in 1000, or about 0.1%. Substituting the given masses into the equation\ndefining mass percentage yields:\nThe computed mass percentage agrees with our rough estimate (it’s a bit less than 0.1%).\nNote that while any mass unit may be used to compute a mass percentage (mg, g, kg, oz, and so on), the same\nunit must be used for both the solute and the solution so that the mass units cancel, yielding a dimensionless\nratio. In this case, the solute mass unit in the numerator was converted from mg to g to match the units in the\ndenominator. Alternatively, the spinal fluid mass unit in the denominator could have been converted from g to\nmg instead. As long as identical mass units are used for both solute and solution, the computed mass\npercentage will be correct.\nCheck Your Learning\nA bottle of a tile cleanser contains 135 g of HCl and 775 g of water.

The density of this solution is 1.19 g/mL. What mass of HCl is contained in 0.500 L of this solution?\nSolution\nThe HCl concentration is near 40%, so a 100-g portion of this solution would contain about 40 g of HCl. Since\nthe solution density isn’t greatly different from that of water (1 g/mL), a reasonable estimate of the HCl mass in\n500 g (0.5 L) of the solution is about five times greater than that in a 100 g portion, or 5\n40 = 200 g. In order to\nderive the mass of solute in a solution from its mass percentage, the mass of the solution must be known.\nUsing the solution density given, convert the solution’s volume to mass, and then use the given mass\npercentage to calculate the solute mass. This mathematical approach is outlined in this flowchart:\nFor proper unit cancellation, the 0.500-L volume is converted into 500 mL, and the mass percentage is\nexpressed as a ratio, 37.2 g HCl/g solution:\n3.4 • Other Units for Solution Concentrations\n145",

The specific units used for solute mass and solution volume may vary,\ndepending on the solution.

The concentration of glucose in blood (commonly referred to as “blood sugar”) is also typically\nexpressed in terms of a mass-volume ratio.

There are also ppm and ppb units defined with\nrespect to numbers of atoms and molecules.\nThe mass-based definitions of ppm and ppb are given here:\nBoth ppm and ppb are convenient units for reporting the concentrations of pollutants and other trace\ncontaminants in water.

When\natoms gain or lose electrons to yield ions, or combine with other atoms to form molecules, their symbols are\nmodified or combined to generate chemical formulas that appropriately represent these species. Extending\nthis symbolism to represent both the identities and the relative quantities of substances undergoing a\nchemical (or physical) change involves writing and balancing a chemical equation. Consider as an example\nthe reaction between one methane molecule (CH4) and two diatomic oxygen molecules (O2) to produce one\ncarbon dioxide molecule (CO2) and two water molecules (H2O). The chemical equation representing this\nprocess is provided in the upper half of Figure 4.2, with space-filling molecular models shown in the lower half\nof the figure.\nFIGURE 4.2\nThe reaction between methane and oxygen to yield carbon dioxide and water (shown at bottom) may\nbe represented by a chemical equation using formulas (top).\nThis example illustrates the fundamental aspects of any chemical equation:\n1.\nThe substances undergoing reaction are called reactants, and their formulas are placed on the left side of\nthe equation.\n2.\nThe substances generated by the reaction are called products, and their formulas are placed on the right\nside of the equation.\n3.\nPlus signs (+) separate individual reactant and product formulas, and an arrow\nseparates the\nreactant and product (left and right) sides of the equation.\n4.\nThe relative numbers of reactant and product species are represented by coefficients (numbers placed\nimmediately to the left of each formula). A coefficient of 1 is typically omitted.\nIt is common practice to use the smallest possible whole-number coefficients in a chemical equation, as is\ndone in this example. Realize, however, that these coefficients represent the relative numbers of reactants and\nproducts, and, therefore, they may be correctly interpreted as ratios. Methane and oxygen react to yield carbon\ndioxide and water in a 1:2:1:2 ratio. This ratio is satisfied if the numbers of these molecules are, respectively,\n1-2-1-2, or 2-4-2-4, or 3-6-3-6, and so on (Figure 4.3). Likewise, these coefficients may be interpreted with\nregard to any amount (number) unit, and so this equation may be correctly read in many ways, including:\n•\nOne methane molecule and two oxygen molecules react to yield one carbon dioxide molecule and two\nwater molecules.\n•\nOne dozen methane molecules and two dozen oxygen molecules react to yield one dozen carbon dioxide\nmolecules and two dozen water molecules.\n•\nOne mole of methane molecules and 2 moles of oxygen molecules react to yield 1 mole of carbon dioxide\n160\n4 • Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

This is a requirement the\nequation must satisfy to be consistent with the law of conservation of matter. It may be confirmed by simply\nsumming the numbers of atoms on either side of the arrow and comparing these sums to ensure they are\nequal. Note that the number of atoms for a given element is calculated by multiplying the coefficient of any\nformula containing that element by the element’s subscript in the formula. If an element appears in more than\none formula on a given side of the equation, the number of atoms represented in each must be computed and\nthen added together. For example, both product species in the example reaction, CO2 and H2O, contain the\nelement oxygen, and so the number of oxygen atoms on the product side of the equation is\nThe equation for the reaction between methane and oxygen to yield carbon dioxide and water is confirmed to\nbe balanced per this approach, as shown here:\nElement\nReactants\nProducts\nBalanced?\nC\n1\n1 = 1\n1\n1 = 1\n1 = 1, yes\nH\n4\n1 = 4\n2\n2 = 4\n4 = 4, yes\nO\n2\n2 = 4\n(1\n2) + (2\n1) = 4\n4 = 4, yes\nA balanced chemical equation often may be derived from a qualitative description of some chemical reaction\nby a fairly simple approach known as balancing by inspection.

Substances with relatively low\nsolubilities are said to be insoluble, and these are the substances that readily precipitate from solution.

The subject of acid-base\nchemistry, therefore, is worthy of thorough discussion, and a full chapter is devoted to this topic later in the\ntext.\nFor purposes of this brief introduction, we will consider only the more common types of acid-base reactions\nthat take place in aqueous solutions. In this context, an acid is a substance that will dissolve in water to yield\nhydronium ions, H3O+. As an example, consider the equation shown here:\nThe process represented by this equation confirms that hydrogen chloride is an acid. When dissolved in water,\nH3O+ ions are produced by a chemical reaction in which H+ ions are transferred from HCl molecules to H2O\nmolecules (Figure 4.5).\n4.2 • Classifying Chemical Reactions\n169",

The most common bases are\nionic compounds composed of alkali or alkaline earth metal cations (groups 1 and 2) combined with the\nhydroxide ion—for example, NaOH and Ca(OH)2. Unlike the acid compounds discussed previously, these\ncompounds do not react chemically with water; instead they dissolve and dissociate, releasing hydroxide ions\ndirectly into the solution. For example, KOH and Ba(OH)2 dissolve in water and dissociate completely to\nproduce cations (K+ and Ba2+, respectively) and hydroxide ions, OH−. These bases, along with other hydroxides\nthat completely dissociate in water, are considered strong bases.\nConsider as an example the dissolution of lye (sodium hydroxide) in water:\nThis equation confirms that sodium hydroxide is a base. When dissolved in water, NaOH dissociates to yield\nNa+ and OH−ions. This is also true for any other ionic compound containing hydroxide ions. Since the\ndissociation process is essentially complete when ionic compounds dissolve in water under typical conditions,\nNaOH and other ionic hydroxides are all classified as strong bases.\nUnlike ionic hydroxides, some compounds produce hydroxide ions when dissolved by chemically reacting with\nwater molecules. In all cases, these compounds react only partially and so are classified as weak bases. These\ntypes of compounds are also abundant in nature and important commodities in various technologies. For\nexample, global production of the weak base ammonia is typically well over 100 metric tons annually, being\nwidely used as an agricultural fertilizer, a raw material for chemical synthesis of other compounds, and an\nactive ingredient in household cleaners (Figure 4.7). When dissolved in water, ammonia reacts partially to\nyield hydroxide ions, as shown here:\nThis is, by definition, an acid-base reaction, in this case involving the transfer of H+ ions from water molecules\nto ammonia molecules.

The lining of the esophagus is not\nprotected from the corrosive effects of stomach acid the way the lining of the stomach is, and the results\ncan be very painful. When we have heartburn, it feels better if we reduce the excess acid in the esophagus\nby taking an antacid. As you may have guessed, antacids are bases.

When it reacts with an acid such as lemon juice,\nbuttermilk, or sour cream in a batter, bubbles of carbon dioxide gas are formed from decomposition of the\nresulting carbonic acid, and the batter “rises.” Baking powder is a combination of sodium bicarbonate, and\none or more acid salts that react when the two chemicals come in contact with water in the batter.\nMany people like to put lemon juice or vinegar, both of which are acids, on cooked fish (Figure 4.8). It turns\nout that fish have volatile amines (bases) in their systems, which are neutralized by the acids to yield\ninvolatile ammonium salts.

These quantitative relationships are known as the reaction’s stoichiometry, a term derived from\nthe Greek words stoicheion (meaning “element”) and metron (meaning “measure”). In this module, the use of\nbalanced chemical equations for various stoichiometric applications is explored.\nThe general approach to using stoichiometric relationships is similar in concept to the way people go about\nmany common activities. Food preparation, for example, offers an appropriate comparison. A recipe for\nmaking eight pancakes calls for 1 cup pancake mix,\ncup milk, and one egg.

All the exercises of the preceding module involved stoichiometric\namounts of reactants. For example, when calculating the amount of product generated from a given amount of\nreactant, it was assumed that any other reactants required were available in stoichiometric amounts (or\ngreater). In this module, more realistic situations are considered, in which reactants are not present in\nstoichiometric amounts.\nLimiting Reactant\nConsider another food analogy, making grilled cheese sandwiches (Figure 4.13):\nStoichiometric amounts of sandwich ingredients for this recipe are bread and cheese slices in a 2:1 ratio.\nChemistry in Everyday Life\nAirbags\nAirbags (Figure 4.12) are a safety feature provided in most automobiles since the 1990s. The effective\noperation of an airbag requires that it be rapidly inflated with an appropriate amount (volume) of gas when\nthe vehicle is involved in a collision. This requirement is satisfied in many automotive airbag systems\nthrough use of explosive chemical reactions, one common choice being the decomposition of sodium\nazide, NaN3. When sensors in the vehicle detect a collision, an electrical current is passed through a\ncarefully measured amount of NaN3 to initiate its decomposition:\nThis reaction is very rapid, generating gaseous nitrogen that can deploy and fully inflate a typical airbag in\na fraction of a second (~0.03–0.1 s). Among many engineering considerations, the amount of sodium azide\nused must be appropriate for generating enough nitrogen gas to fully inflate the air bag and ensure its\nproper function. For example, a small mass (~100 g) of NaN3 will generate approximately 50 L of N2.\nFIGURE 4.12\nAirbags deploy upon impact to minimize serious injuries to passengers.

In this scenario, the number of\nsandwiches prepared has been limited by the number of cheese slices, and the bread slices have been\nprovided in excess.\nFIGURE 4.13\nSandwich making can illustrate the concepts of limiting and excess reactants.\nConsider this concept now with regard to a chemical process, the reaction of hydrogen with chlorine to yield\nhydrogen chloride:\nThe balanced equation shows the hydrogen and chlorine react in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio. If these reactants\nare provided in any other amounts, one of the reactants will nearly always be entirely consumed, thus limiting\nthe amount of product that may be generated. This substance is the limiting reactant, and the other substance\nis the excess reactant. Identifying the limiting and excess reactants for a given situation requires computing\nthe molar amounts of each reactant provided and comparing them to the stoichiometric amounts represented\nin the balanced chemical equation. For example, imagine combining 3 moles of H2 and 2 moles of Cl2. This\nrepresents a 3:2 (or 1.5:1) ratio of hydrogen to chlorine present for reaction, which is greater than the\nstoichiometric ratio of 1:1.

In\npractice, the amount of product obtained is called the actual yield, and it is often less than the theoretical yield\nfor a number of reasons. Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that\ngenerate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and\nbases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less\nthan perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield. The extent to which a reaction’s theoretical yield is achieved\nis commonly expressed as its percent yield:\nActual and theoretical yields may be expressed as masses or molar amounts (or any other appropriate\nproperty; e.g., volume, if the product is a gas).

Green chemistry is a\nphilosophical approach that is being applied to many areas of science and technology, and its practice is\nsummarized by guidelines known as the “Twelve Principles of Green Chemistry” (see details at this website\n(http://openstax.org/l/16greenchem)). One of the 12 principles is aimed specifically at maximizing the\nefficiency of processes for synthesizing chemical products. The atom economy of a process is a measure of this\nefficiency, defined as the percentage by mass of the final product of a synthesis relative to the masses of all the\nreactants used:\nThough the definition of atom economy at first glance appears very similar to that for percent yield, be aware\nthat this property represents a difference in the theoretical efficiencies of different chemical processes. The\npercent yield of a given chemical process, on the other hand, evaluates the efficiency of a process by\ncomparing the yield of product actually obtained to the maximum yield predicted by stoichiometry.\nThe synthesis of the common nonprescription pain medication, ibuprofen, nicely illustrates the success of a\ngreen chemistry approach (Figure 4.15). First marketed in the early 1960s, ibuprofen was produced using a\nsix-step synthesis that required 514 g of reactants to generate each mole (206 g) of ibuprofen, an atom\neconomy of 40%. In the 1990s, an alternative process was developed by the BHC Company (now BASF\nCorporation) that requires only three steps and has an atom economy of ~80%, nearly twice that of the original\nprocess. The BHC process generates significantly less chemical waste; uses less-hazardous and recyclable\nmaterials; and provides significant cost-savings to the manufacturer (and, subsequently, the consumer). In\nrecognition of the positive environmental impact of the BHC process, the company received the Environmental\nProtection Agency’s Greener Synthetic Pathways Award in 1997.\n4.4 • Reaction Yields\n189",

The\ngreater the weight of potassium carbonate added to reach the point where the bubbling ended, the more\nconcentrated the vinegar.\nWe now know that the effervescence that occurred during this process was due to reaction with acetic acid,\nCH3CO2H, the compound primarily responsible for the odor and taste of vinegar. Acetic acid reacts with\npotassium carbonate according to the following equation:\nThe bubbling was due to the production of CO2.\nThe test of vinegar with potassium carbonate is one type of quantitative analysis—the determination of the\n190\n4 • Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

In the analysis of vinegar, the concentration of the solute\n(acetic acid) was determined from the amount of reactant that combined with the solute present in a known\nvolume of the solution. In other types of chemical analyses, the amount of a substance present in a sample is\ndetermined by measuring the amount of product that results.\nTitration\nThe described approach to measuring vinegar strength was an early version of the analytical technique known\nas titration analysis. A typical titration analysis involves the use of a buret (Figure 4.16) to make incremental\nadditions of a solution containing a known concentration of some substance (the titrant) to a sample solution\ncontaining the substance whose concentration is to be measured (the analyte). The titrant and analyte\nundergo a chemical reaction of known stoichiometry, and so measuring the volume of titrant solution required\nfor complete reaction with the analyte (the equivalence point of the titration) allows calculation of the analyte\nconcentration. The equivalence point of a titration may be detected visually if a distinct change in the\nappearance of the sample solution accompanies the completion of the reaction. The halt of bubble formation\nin the classic vinegar analysis is one such example, though, more commonly, special dyes called indicators are\nadded to the sample solutions to impart a change in color at or very near the equivalence point of the titration.\nEquivalence points may also be detected by measuring some solution property that changes in a predictable\nway during the course of the titration. Regardless of the approach taken to detect a titration’s equivalence\npoint, the volume of titrant actually measured is called the end point. Properly designed titration methods\ntypically ensure that the difference between the equivalence and end points is negligible. Though any type of\nchemical reaction may serve as the basis for a titration analysis, the three described in this chapter\n(precipitation, acid-base, and redox) are most common. Additional details regarding titration analysis are\nprovided in the chapter on acid-base equilibria.\nFIGURE 4.16\n(a) A student fills a buret in preparation for a titration analysis.

Formulas for the\nsubstances undergoing the change (reactants) and\nsubstances generated by the change (products) are\nseparated by an arrow and preceded by integer\ncoefficients indicating their relative numbers.\nBalanced equations are those whose coefficients\nresult in equal numbers of atoms for each element\nin the reactants and products. Chemical reactions in\naqueous solution that involve ionic reactants or\nproducts may be represented more realistically by\ncomplete ionic equations and, more succinctly, by\nnet ionic equations.\n4.2 Classifying Chemical Reactions\nChemical reactions are classified according to\nsimilar patterns of behavior. A large number of\nimportant reactions are included in three\ncategories: precipitation, acid-base, and oxidation-\nreduction (redox). Precipitation reactions involve\nthe formation of one or more insoluble products.\nAcid-base reactions involve the transfer of hydrogen\nions between reactants. Redox reactions involve a\nchange in oxidation number for one or more\nreactant elements. Writing balanced equations for\nsome redox reactions that occur in aqueous\nsolutions is simplified by using a systematic\napproach called the half-reaction method.\n4.3 Reaction Stoichiometry\nA balanced chemical equation may be used to\ndescribe a reaction’s stoichiometry (the\nrelationships between amounts of reactants and\nproducts). Coefficients from the equation are used to\nderive stoichiometric factors that subsequently may\nbe used for computations relating reactant and\nproduct masses, molar amounts, and other\nquantitative properties.\n4.4 Reaction Yields\nWhen reactions are carried out using less-than-\nstoichiometric quantities of reactants, the amount of\nproduct generated will be determined by the\nlimiting reactant. The amount of product generated\nby a chemical reaction is its actual yield. This yield\nis often less than the amount of product predicted by\nthe stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation\nrepresenting the reaction (its theoretical yield). The\nextent to which a reaction generates the theoretical\namount of product is expressed as its percent yield.\n4 • Key Equations\n199",

          "text": "4.5 Quantitative Chemical Analysis\nThe stoichiometry of chemical reactions may serve\nas the basis for quantitative chemical analysis\nmethods. Titrations involve measuring the volume\nof a titrant solution required to completely react\nwith a sample solution. This volume is then used to\ncalculate the concentration of analyte in the sample\nusing the stoichiometry of the titration reaction.\nGravimetric analysis involves separating the analyte\nfrom the sample by a physical or chemical process,\ndetermining its mass, and then calculating its\nconcentration in the sample based on the\nstoichiometry of the relevant process. Combustion\nanalysis is a gravimetric method used to determine\nthe elemental composition of a compound by\ncollecting and weighing the gaseous products of its\ncombustion.\nExercises\n4.1 Writing and Balancing Chemical Equations\n1.

Societies at all levels of development could not function without the energy released\nby chemical reactions. In 2012, about 85% of US energy consumption came from the combustion of petroleum\nproducts, coal, wood, and garbage. We use this energy to produce electricity (38%); to transport food, raw\nmaterials, manufactured goods, and people (27%); for industrial production (21%); and to heat and power our\nhomes and businesses (10%).1 While these combustion reactions help us meet our essential energy needs,\nthey are also recognized by the majority of the scientific community as a major contributor to global climate\nchange.\nUseful forms of energy are also available from a variety of chemical reactions other than combustion. For\nexample, the energy produced by the batteries in a cell phone, car, or flashlight results from chemical\nreactions. This chapter introduces many of the basic ideas necessary to explore the relationships between\nchemical changes and energy, with a focus on thermal energy.\nFigure 5.1\nSliding a match head along a rough surface initiates a combustion reaction that produces energy in the\nform of heat and light.

The macronutrients in food (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates) undergo metabolic reactions that\nprovide the energy to keep our bodies functioning. We burn a variety of fuels (gasoline, natural gas, coal) to\nproduce energy for transportation, heating, and the generation of electricity. Industrial chemical reactions use\nenormous amounts of energy to produce raw materials (such as iron and aluminum). Energy is then used to\nmanufacture those raw materials into useful products, such as cars, skyscrapers, and bridges.\nFIGURE 5.2\nThe energy involved in chemical changes is important to our daily lives: (a) A cheeseburger for lunch\nprovides the energy you need to get through the rest of the day; (b) the combustion of gasoline provides the energy\nthat moves your car (and you) between home, work, and school; and (c) coke, a processed form of coal, provides the\nenergy needed to convert iron ore into iron, which is essential for making many of the products we use daily. (credit\na: modification of work by “Pink Sherbet Photography”/Flickr; credit b: modification of work by Jeffery Turner)\nOver 90% of the energy we use comes originally from the sun. Every day, the sun provides the earth with\nalmost 10,000 times the amount of energy necessary to meet all of the world’s energy needs for that day. Our\nchallenge is to find ways to convert and store incoming solar energy so that it can be used in reactions or\nchemical processes that are both convenient and nonpolluting. Plants and many bacteria capture solar energy\nthrough photosynthesis. We release the energy stored in plants when we burn wood or plant products such as\nethanol. We also use this energy to fuel our bodies by eating food that comes directly from plants or from\nanimals that got their energy by eating plants. Burning coal and petroleum also releases stored solar energy:\nThese fuels are fossilized plant and animal matter.\nThis chapter will introduce the basic ideas of an important area of science concerned with the amount of heat\nabsorbed or released during chemical and physical changes—an area called thermochemistry. The concepts\nintroduced in this chapter are widely used in almost all scientific and technical fields. Food scientists use them\nto determine the energy content of foods. Biologists study the energetics of living organisms, such as the\nmetabolic combustion of sugar into carbon dioxide and water. The oil, gas, and transportation industries,\nrenewable energy providers, and many others endeavor to find better methods to produce energy for our\ncommercial and personal needs. Engineers strive to improve energy efficiency, find better ways to heat and\ncool our homes, refrigerate our food and drinks, and meet the energy and cooling needs of computers and\nelectronics, among other applications. Understanding thermochemical principles is essential for chemists,\nphysicists, biologists, geologists, every type of engineer, and just about anyone who studies or does any kind of\nscience.\n212\n5 • Thermochemistry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

          "text": "Energy\nEnergy can be defined as the capacity to supply heat or do work. One type of work (w) is the process of causing\nmatter to move against an opposing force. For example, we do work when we inflate a bicycle tire—we move\nmatter (the air in the pump) against the opposing force of the air already in the tire.\nLike matter, energy comes in different types. One scheme classifies energy into two types: potential energy,\nthe energy an object has because of its relative position, composition, or condition, and kinetic energy, the\nenergy that an object possesses because of its motion. Water at the top of a waterfall or dam has potential\nenergy because of its position; when it flows downward through generators, it has kinetic energy that can be\nused to do work and produce electricity in a hydroelectric plant (Figure 5.3). A battery has potential energy\nbecause the chemicals within it can produce electricity that can do work.\nFIGURE 5.3\n(a) Water at a higher elevation, for example, at the top of Victoria Falls, has a higher potential energy\nthan water at a lower elevation. As the water falls, some of its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. (b) If\nthe water flows through generators at the bottom of a dam, such as the Hoover Dam shown here, its kinetic energy\nis converted into electrical energy. (credit a: modification of work by Steve Jurvetson; credit b: modification of work\nby “curimedia”/Wikimedia commons)\nEnergy can be converted from one form into another, but all of the energy present before a change occurs\nalways exists in some form after the change is completed. This observation is expressed in the law of\nconservation of energy: during a chemical or physical change, energy can be neither created nor destroyed,\nalthough it can be changed in form. (This is also one version of the first law of thermodynamics, as you will\nlearn later.)\nWhen one substance is converted into another, there is always an associated conversion of one form of energy\ninto another. Heat is usually released or absorbed, but sometimes the conversion involves light, electrical\nenergy, or some other form of energy. For example, chemical energy (a type of potential energy) is stored in the\nmolecules that compose gasoline. When gasoline is combusted within the cylinders of a car’s engine, the\nrapidly expanding gaseous products of this chemical reaction generate mechanical energy (a type of kinetic\nenergy) when they move the cylinders’ pistons.\nAccording to the law of conservation of matter (seen in an earlier chapter), there is no detectable change in the\ntotal amount of matter during a chemical change. When chemical reactions occur, the energy changes are\nrelatively modest and the mass changes are too small to measure, so the laws of conservation of matter and\nenergy hold well. However, in nuclear reactions, the energy changes are much larger (by factors of a million or\nso), the mass changes are measurable, and matter-energy conversions are significant. This will be examined in\nmore detail in a later chapter on nuclear chemistry.\nThermal Energy, Temperature, and Heat\nThermal energy is kinetic energy associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules.

Heat flow (a\nredundant term, but one commonly used) increases the thermal energy of one body and decreases the thermal\nenergy of the other. Suppose we initially have a high temperature (and high thermal energy) substance (H) and\na low temperature (and low thermal energy) substance (L). The atoms and molecules in H have a higher\naverage KE than those in L. If we place substance H in contact with substance L, the thermal energy will flow\nspontaneously from substance H to substance L. The temperature of substance H will decrease, as will the\naverage KE of its molecules; the temperature of substance L will increase, along with the average KE of its\nmolecules. Heat flow will continue until the two substances are at the same temperature (Figure 5.6).\nFIGURE 5.6\n(a) Substances H and L are initially at different temperatures, and their atoms have different average\nkinetic energies. (b) When they contact each other, collisions between the molecules result in the transfer of kinetic\n(thermal) energy from the hotter to the cooler matter.

A change that releases\nheat is called an exothermic process. For example, the combustion reaction that occurs when using an\noxyacetylene torch is an exothermic process—this process also releases energy in the form of light as\nevidenced by the torch’s flame (Figure 5.7). A reaction or change that absorbs heat is an endothermic process.\nA cold pack used to treat muscle strains provides an example of an endothermic process. When the substances\nin the cold pack (water and a salt like ammonium nitrate) are brought together, the resulting process absorbs\nheat, leading to the sensation of cold.\n5.1 • Energy Basics\n215",

(credit a:\nmodification of work by “Skatebiker”/Wikimedia commons)\nHistorically, energy was measured in units of calories (cal). A calorie is the amount of energy required to raise\none gram of water by 1 degree C (1 kelvin). However, this quantity depends on the atmospheric pressure and\nthe starting temperature of the water. The ease of measurement of energy changes in calories has meant that\nthe calorie is still frequently used. The Calorie (with a capital C), or large calorie, commonly used in quantifying\nfood energy content, is a kilocalorie. The SI unit of heat, work, and energy is the joule. A joule (J) is defined as\nthe amount of energy used when a force of 1 newton moves an object 1 meter. It is named in honor of the\nEnglish physicist James Prescott Joule. One joule is equivalent to 1 kg m2/s2, which is also called 1\nnewton–meter. A kilojoule (kJ) is 1000 joules. To standardize its definition, 1 calorie has been set to equal\n4.184 joules.\nWe now introduce two concepts useful in describing heat flow and temperature change. The heat capacity (C)\nof a body of matter is the quantity of heat (q) it absorbs or releases when it experiences a temperature change\n(ΔT) of 1 degree Celsius (or equivalently, 1 kelvin):\nHeat capacity is determined by both the type and amount of substance that absorbs or releases heat. It is\ntherefore an extensive property—its value is proportional to the amount of the substance.\nFor example, consider the heat capacities of two cast iron frying pans. The heat capacity of the large pan is five\ntimes greater than that of the small pan because, although both are made of the same material, the mass of the\nlarge pan is five times greater than the mass of the small pan. More mass means more atoms are present in the\nlarger pan, so it takes more energy to make all of those atoms vibrate faster. The heat capacity of the small cast\niron frying pan is found by observing that it takes 18,150 J of energy to raise the temperature of the pan by\n50.0 °C:\nThe larger cast iron frying pan, while made of the same substance, requires 90,700 J of energy to raise its\ntemperature by 50.0 °C. The larger pan has a (proportionally) larger heat capacity because the larger amount\nof material requires a (proportionally) larger amount of energy to yield the same temperature change:\nThe specific heat capacity (c) of a substance, commonly called its “specific heat,” is the quantity of heat\n216\n5 • Thermochemistry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

The specific heat of iron (the material used to make the pan) is therefore:\nThe large frying pan has a mass of 4040 g. Using the data for this pan, we can also calculate the specific heat of\niron:\nAlthough the large pan is more massive than the small pan, since both are made of the same material, they\nboth yield the same value for specific heat (for the material of construction, iron). Note that specific heat is\nmeasured in units of energy per temperature per mass and is an intensive property, being derived from a ratio\nof two extensive properties (heat and mass). The molar heat capacity, also an intensive property, is the heat\ncapacity per mole of a particular substance and has units of J/mol °C (Figure 5.8).\nFIGURE 5.8\nBecause of its larger mass, a large frying pan has a larger heat capacity than a small frying pan.\nBecause they are made of the same material, both frying pans have the same specific heat.

Large-scale solar thermal plants have different design specifics, but all concentrate\nsunlight to heat some substance; the heat “stored” in that substance is then converted into electricity.\nThe Solana Generating Station in Arizona’s Sonora Desert produces 280 megawatts of electrical power. It\nuses parabolic mirrors that focus sunlight on pipes filled with a heat transfer fluid (HTF) (Figure 5.9). The\nHTF then does two things: It turns water into steam, which spins turbines, which in turn produces\nelectricity, and it melts and heats a mixture of salts, which functions as a thermal energy storage system.\nAfter the sun goes down, the molten salt mixture can then release enough of its stored heat to produce\nsteam to run the turbines for 6 hours. Molten salts are used because they possess a number of beneficial\nproperties, including high heat capacities and thermal conductivities.\nFIGURE 5.9\nThis solar thermal plant uses parabolic trough mirrors to concentrate sunlight.

Calorimetry is used to measure amounts of heat transferred to or from a substance. To do so,\nthe heat is exchanged with a calibrated object (calorimeter). The temperature change measured by the\ncalorimeter is used to derive the amount of heat transferred by the process under study. The measurement of\nheat transfer using this approach requires the definition of a system (the substance or substances undergoing\nthe chemical or physical change) and its surroundings (all other matter, including components of the\nmeasurement apparatus, that serve to either provide heat to the system or absorb heat from the system).\nA calorimeter is a device used to measure the amount of heat involved in a chemical or physical process. For\nexample, when an exothermic reaction occurs in solution in a calorimeter, the heat produced by the reaction is\nabsorbed by the solution, which increases its temperature. When an endothermic reaction occurs, the heat\nrequired is absorbed from the thermal energy of the solution, which decreases its temperature (Figure 5.11).\nThe temperature change, along with the specific heat and mass of the solution, can then be used to calculate\nthe amount of heat involved in either case.\nFIGURE 5.10\n(a) The Ivanpah solar thermal plant uses 170,000 mirrors to concentrate sunlight on water-filled\ntowers.

When thermal energy is lost, the intensities of these motions decrease and the kinetic\nenergy falls. The total of all possible kinds of energy present in a substance is called the internal energy (U),\nsometimes symbolized as E.\nAs a system undergoes a change, its internal energy can change, and energy can be transferred from the\nsystem to the surroundings, or from the surroundings to the system. Energy is transferred into a system when\nit absorbs heat (q) from the surroundings or when the surroundings do work (w) on the system. For example,\nenergy is transferred into room-temperature metal wire if it is immersed in hot water (the wire absorbs heat\nfrom the water), or if you rapidly bend the wire back and forth (the wire becomes warmer because of the work\ndone on it). Both processes increase the internal energy of the wire, which is reflected in an increase in the\nwire’s temperature. Conversely, energy is transferred out of a system when heat is lost from the system, or\nwhen the system does work on the surroundings.\nThe relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be represented by the equation:\nas shown in Figure 5.19. This is one version of the first law of thermodynamics, and it shows that the internal\nenergy of a system changes through heat flow into or out of the system (positive q is heat flow in; negative q is\nheat flow out) or work done on or by the system. The work, w, is positive if it is done on the system and negative\nif it is done by the system.\nFIGURE 5.19\nThe internal energy, U, of a system can be changed by heat flow and work. If heat flows into the\nsystem, qin, or work is done on the system, won, its internal energy increases, ΔU > 0. If heat flows out of the system,\nqout, or work is done by the system, wby, its internal energy decreases, ΔU < 0.\nA type of work called expansion work (or pressure-volume work) occurs when a system pushes back the\n5.3 • Enthalpy\n233",

The reaction of gasoline and oxygen is\nexothermic. Some of this energy is given off as heat, and some does work pushing the piston in the cylinder.\nThe substances involved in the reaction are the system, and the engine and the rest of the universe are the\nsurroundings. The system loses energy by both heating and doing work on the surroundings, and its internal\nenergy decreases.

The value of a state function depends only on the state that a system is in, and not on how that state\nis reached. If a quantity is not a state function, then its value does depend on how the state is reached. An\nexample of a state function is altitude or elevation. If you stand on the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro, you are at an\naltitude of 5895 m, and it does not matter whether you hiked there or parachuted there. The distance you\ntraveled to the top of Kilimanjaro, however, is not a state function. You could climb to the summit by a direct\nroute or by a more roundabout, circuitous path (Figure 5.20). The distances traveled would differ (distance is\nnot a state function) but the elevation reached would be the same (altitude is a state function).\nFIGURE 5.20\nPaths X and Y represent two different routes to the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Both have the same\nchange in elevation (altitude or elevation on a mountain is a state function; it does not depend on path), but they\nhave very different distances traveled (distance walked is not a state function; it depends on the path).

Enthalpy is defined as the sum of a system’s internal energy (U) and the mathematical\nproduct of its pressure (P) and volume (V):\nEnthalpy is also a state function. Enthalpy values for specific substances cannot be measured directly; only\nenthalpy changes for chemical or physical processes can be determined.

What is the\nenthalpy change for the reaction when 1 mole of FeCl2(s) is produced?\nAnswer:\nΔH = −338 kJ\nEnthalpy changes are typically tabulated for reactions in which both the reactants and products are at the\nsame conditions. A standard state is a commonly accepted set of conditions used as a reference point for the\ndetermination of properties under other different conditions. For chemists, the IUPAC standard state refers to\nmaterials under a pressure of 1 bar and solutions at 1 M, and does not specify a temperature. Many\nthermochemical tables list values with a standard state of 1 atm. Because the ΔH of a reaction changes very\nlittle with such small changes in pressure (1 bar = 0.987 atm), ΔH values (except for the most precisely\nmeasured values) are essentially the same under both sets of standard conditions. We will include a\nsuperscripted “o” in the enthalpy change symbol to designate standard state. Since the usual (but not\ntechnically standard) temperature is 298.15 K, this temperature will be assumed unless some other\ntemperature is specified. Thus, the symbol\nis used to indicate an enthalpy change for a process\noccurring under these conditions. (The symbol ΔH is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a reaction\noccurring under nonstandard conditions.)\nThe enthalpy changes for many types of chemical and physical processes are available in the reference\nliterature, including those for combustion reactions, phase transitions, and formation reactions. As we discuss\nthese quantities, it is important to pay attention to the extensive nature of enthalpy and enthalpy changes.\nSince the enthalpy change for a given reaction is proportional to the amounts of substances involved, it may be\nreported on that basis (i.e., as the ΔH for specific amounts of reactants). However, we often find it more useful\nto divide one extensive property (ΔH) by another (amount of substance), and report a per-amount intensive\nvalue of ΔH, often “normalized” to a per-mole basis. (Note that this is similar to determining the intensive\nproperty specific heat from the extensive property heat capacity, as seen previously.)\nStandard Enthalpy of Combustion\nStandard enthalpy of combustion\nis the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a substance burns\n(combines vigorously with oxygen) under standard state conditions; it is sometimes called “heat of\ncombustion.” For example, the enthalpy of combustion of ethanol, −1366.8 kJ/mol, is the amount of heat\nproduced when one mole of ethanol undergoes complete combustion at 25 °C and 1 atmosphere pressure,\nyielding products also at 25 °C and 1 atm.\nEnthalpies of combustion for many substances have been measured; a few of these are listed in Table 5.2.\nMany readily available substances with large enthalpies of combustion are used as fuels, including hydrogen,\ncarbon (as coal or charcoal), and hydrocarbons (compounds containing only hydrogen and carbon), such as\nmethane, propane, and the major components of gasoline.\n5.3 • Enthalpy\n237",

Some reactions are difficult, if not\nimpossible, to investigate and make accurate measurements for experimentally. And even when a reaction is\nnot hard to perform or measure, it is convenient to be able to determine the heat involved in a reaction without\nhaving to perform an experiment.\nThis type of calculation usually involves the use of Hess’s law, which states: If a process can be written as the\nsum of several stepwise processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy\nchanges of the various steps. Hess’s law is valid because enthalpy is a state function: Enthalpy changes depend\nonly on where a chemical process starts and ends, but not on the path it takes from start to finish. For example,\nwe can think of the reaction of carbon with oxygen to form carbon dioxide as occurring either directly or by a\ntwo-step process. The direct process is written:\nIn the two-step process, first carbon monoxide is formed:\nThen, carbon monoxide reacts further to form carbon dioxide:\nThe equation describing the overall reaction is the sum of these two chemical changes:\nBecause the CO produced in Step 1 is consumed in Step 2, the net change is:\nAccording to Hess’s law, the enthalpy change of the reaction will equal the sum of the enthalpy changes of the\nsteps.\nThe result is shown in Figure 5.24.

          "text": "Key Equations\nSummary\n5.1 Energy Basics\nEnergy is the capacity to supply heat or do work\n(applying a force to move matter). Kinetic energy\n(KE) is the energy of motion; potential energy is\nenergy due to relative position, composition, or\ncondition. When energy is converted from one form\ninto another, energy is neither created nor destroyed\n(law of conservation of energy or first law of\nthermodynamics).\nThe thermal energy of matter is due to the kinetic\nenergies of its constituent atoms or molecules.\nTemperature is an intensive property of matter\nreflecting hotness or coldness that increases as the\naverage kinetic energy increases. Heat is the\ntransfer of thermal energy between objects at\ndifferent temperatures. Chemical and physical\nprocesses can absorb heat (endothermic) or release\nheat (exothermic). The SI unit of energy, heat, and\nwork is the joule (J).\nSpecific heat and heat capacity are measures of the\nenergy needed to change the temperature of a\nsubstance or object. The amount of heat absorbed or\nreleased by a substance depends directly on the type\nof substance, its mass, and the temperature change\nit undergoes.\n5.2 Calorimetry\nCalorimetry is used to measure the amount of\nthermal energy transferred in a chemical or physical\nprocess. This requires careful measurement of the\ntemperature change that occurs during the process\nand the masses of the system and surroundings.\nThese measured quantities are then used to\ncompute the amount of heat produced or consumed\nin the process using known mathematical relations.\nCalorimeters are designed to minimize energy\nexchange between their contents and the external\nenvironment. They range from simple coffee cup\ncalorimeters used by introductory chemistry\nstudents to sophisticated bomb calorimeters used to\ndetermine the energy content of food.\n5.3 Enthalpy\nIf a chemical change is carried out at constant\npressure and the only work done is caused by\nexpansion or contraction, q for the change is called\nthe enthalpy change with the symbol ΔH, or\nfor\nreactions occurring under standard state conditions\nat 298 K. The value of ΔH for a reaction in one\ndirection is equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign,\nto ΔH for the reaction in the opposite direction, and\nΔH is directly proportional to the quantity of\nreactants and products. The standard enthalpy of\nformation,\nis the enthalpy change\naccompanying the formation of 1 mole of a\nsubstance from the elements in their most stable\nstates at 1 bar and 298.15 K. If the enthalpies of\nformation are available for the reactants and\nproducts of a reaction, the enthalpy change can be\ncalculated using Hess’s law: If a process can be\nwritten as the sum of several stepwise processes, the\nenthalpy change of the total process equals the sum\nof the enthalpy changes of the various steps.\nExercises\n5.1 Energy Basics\n1.

In the seventeenth century, Isaac Newton\nperformed experiments with lenses and prisms and was able to demonstrate that white light consists of the\nindividual colors of the rainbow combined together. Newton explained his optics findings in terms of a\n\"corpuscular\" view of light, in which light was composed of streams of extremely tiny particles travelling at\nhigh speeds according to Newton's laws of motion. Others in the seventeenth century, such as Christiaan\nHuygens, had shown that optical phenomena such as reflection and refraction could be equally well explained\nin terms of light as waves travelling at high speed through a medium called \"luminiferous aether\" that was\nthought to permeate all space. Early in the nineteenth century, Thomas Young demonstrated that light passing\nthrough narrow, closely spaced slits produced interference patterns that could not be explained in terms of\nNewtonian particles but could be easily explained in terms of waves. Later in the nineteenth century, after\nJames Clerk Maxwell developed his theory of electromagnetic radiation and showed that light was the visible\npart of a vast spectrum of electromagnetic waves, the particle view of light became thoroughly discredited. By\nthe end of the nineteenth century, scientists viewed the physical universe as roughly comprising two separate\ndomains: matter composed of particles moving according to Newton's laws of motion, and electromagnetic\nradiation consisting of waves governed by Maxwell's equations. Today, these domains are referred to as\nclassical mechanics and classical electrodynamics (or classical electromagnetism). Although there were a few\nphysical phenomena that could not be explained within this framework, scientists at that time were so\nconfident of the overall soundness of this framework that they viewed these aberrations as puzzling paradoxes\nthat would ultimately be resolved somehow within this framework. As we shall see, these paradoxes led to a\ncontemporary framework that intimately connects particles and waves at a fundamental level called wave-\nparticle duality, which has superseded the classical view.\nVisible light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation play important roles in chemistry, since they can be\nused to infer the energies of electrons within atoms and molecules. Much of modern technology is based on\nelectromagnetic radiation. For example, radio waves from a mobile phone, X-rays used by dentists, the energy\nused to cook food in your microwave, the radiant heat from red-hot objects, and the light from your television\nscreen are forms of electromagnetic radiation that all exhibit wavelike behavior.\nWaves\nA wave is an oscillation or periodic movement that can transport energy from one point in space to another.\nCommon examples of waves are all around us. Shaking the end of a rope transfers energy from your hand to\nthe other end of the rope, dropping a pebble into a pond causes waves to ripple outward along the water's\nsurface, and the expansion of air that accompanies a lightning strike generates sound waves (thunder) that can\ntravel outward for several miles. In each of these cases, kinetic energy is transferred through matter (the rope,\nwater, or air) while the matter remains essentially in place. An insightful example of a wave occurs in sports\nstadiums when fans in a narrow region of seats rise simultaneously and stand with their arms raised up for a\nfew seconds before sitting down again while the fans in neighboring sections likewise stand up and sit down in\nsequence. While this wave can quickly encircle a large stadium in a few seconds, none of the fans actually\ntravel with the wave-they all stay in or above their seats.\nWaves need not be restricted to travel through matter. As Maxwell showed, electromagnetic waves consist of an\nelectric field oscillating in step with a perpendicular magnetic field, both of which are perpendicular to the\ndirection of travel. These waves can travel through a vacuum at a constant speed of 2.998\n108 m/s, the speed\n258\n6 • Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

          "text": "of light (denoted by c).\nAll waves, including forms of electromagnetic radiation, are characterized by, a wavelength (denoted by λ, the\nlowercase Greek letter lambda), a frequency (denoted by ν, the lowercase Greek letter nu), and an amplitude.\nAs can be seen in Figure 6.2, the wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs in a\nwave (measured in meters in the SI system). Electromagnetic waves have wavelengths that fall within an\nenormous range-wavelengths of kilometers (103 m) to picometers (10−12 m) have been observed. The\nfrequency is the number of wave cycles that pass a specified point in space in a specified amount of time (in\nthe SI system, this is measured in seconds). A cycle corresponds to one complete wavelength. The unit for\nfrequency, expressed as cycles per second [s−1], is the hertz (Hz). Common multiples of this unit are\nmegahertz, (1 MHz = 1\n106 Hz) and gigahertz (1 GHz = 1\n109 Hz). The amplitude corresponds to the\nmagnitude of the wave's displacement and so, in Figure 6.2, this corresponds to one-half the height between\nthe peaks and troughs. The amplitude is related to the intensity of the wave, which for light is the brightness,\nand for sound is the loudness.\nFIGURE 6.2\nOne-dimensional sinusoidal waves show the relationship among wavelength, frequency, and speed.\nThe wave with the shortest wavelength has the highest frequency. Amplitude is one-half the height of the wave from\npeak to trough.\nThe product of a wave's wavelength (λ) and its frequency (ν), λν, is the speed of the wave. Thus, for\nelectromagnetic radiation in a vacuum, speed is equal to the fundamental constant, c:\nWavelength and frequency are inversely proportional: As the wavelength increases, the frequency decreases.\nThe inverse proportionality is illustrated in Figure 6.3. This figure also shows the electromagnetic spectrum,\nthe range of all types of electromagnetic radiation. Each of the various colors of visible light has specific\nfrequencies and wavelengths associated with them, and you can see that visible light makes up only a small\nportion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Because the technologies developed to work in various parts of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum are different, for reasons of convenience and historical legacies, different units are\ntypically used for different parts of the spectrum. For example, radio waves are usually specified as\nfrequencies (typically in units of MHz), while the visible region is usually specified in wavelengths (typically in\nunits of nm or angstroms).\n6.1 • Electromagnetic Energy\n259",

Figure 6.6 shows the interference patterns that arise when light passes through\nnarrow slits closely spaced about a wavelength apart. The fringe patterns produced depend on the wavelength,\nwith the fringes being more closely spaced for shorter wavelength light passing through a given set of slits.\nWhen the light passes through the two slits, each slit effectively acts as a new source, resulting in two closely\nspaced waves coming into contact at the detector (the camera in this case). The dark regions in Figure 6.6\ncorrespond to regions where the peaks for the wave from one slit happen to coincide with the troughs for the\nwave from the other slit (destructive interference), while the brightest regions correspond to the regions where\nthe peaks for the two waves (or their two troughs) happen to coincide (constructive interference). Likewise,\nwhen two stones are tossed close together into a pond, interference patterns are visible in the interactions\nbetween the waves produced by the stones. Such interference patterns cannot be explained by particles\nmoving according to the laws of classical mechanics.\nFIGURE 6.6\nInterference fringe patterns are shown for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The\nspacing of the fringes depends on the wavelength, with the fringes being more closely spaced for the shorter-\nwavelength blue light. (credit: PASCO)\nOther technologies also operate in the radio-wave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. For example,\n4G cellular telephone signals are approximately 880 MHz, while Global Positioning System (GPS) signals\noperate at 1.228 and 1.575 GHz, local area wireless technology (Wi-Fi) networks operate at 2.4 to 5 GHz,\nand highway toll sensors operate at 5.8 GHz. The frequencies associated with these applications are\nconvenient because such waves tend not to be absorbed much by common building materials.\nPortrait of a Chemist\nDorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin\nX-rays exhibit wavelengths of approximately 0.01–10 nm. Since these wavelengths are comparable to the\nspaces between atoms in a crystalline solid, X-rays are scattered when they pass through crystals. The\nscattered rays undergo constructive and destructive interference that creates a specific diffraction pattern\nthat may be measured and used to precisely determine the positions of atoms within the crystal. This\nphenomenon of X-ray diffraction is the basis for very powerful techniques enabling the determination of\nmolecular structure. One of the pioneers who applied this powerful technology to important biochemical\nsubstances was Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin.\nBorn in Cairo, Egypt, in 1910 to British parents, Dorothy’s fascination with chemistry was fostered early in\nher life. At age 11 she was enrolled in a prestigious English grammar school where she was one of just two\ngirls allowed to study chemistry. On her 16th birthday, her mother, Molly, gifted her a book on X-ray\ncrystallography, which had a profound impact on the trajectory of her career. She studied chemistry at\nOxford University, graduating with first-class honors in 1932 and directly entering Cambridge University to\npursue a doctoral degree. At Cambridge, Dorothy recognized the promise of X-ray crystallography for\nprotein structure determinations, conducting research that earned her a PhD in 1937. Over the course of a\nvery productive career, Dr. Hodgkin was credited with determining structures for several important\nbiomolecules, including cholesterol iodide, penicillin, and vitamin B12. In recognition of her achievements\nin the use of X-ray techniques to elucidate the structures of biochemical substances, she was awarded the\n1964 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 1969, she led a team of scientists who deduced the structure of insulin,\nfacilitating the mass production of this hormone and greatly advancing the treatment of diabetic patients\nworldwide. Dr. Hodgkin continued working with the international scientific community, earning numerous\ndistinctions and awards prior to her death in 1993.\n262\n6 • Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

          "text": "Not all waves are travelling waves. Standing waves (also known as stationary waves) remain constrained\nwithin some region of space. As we shall see, standing waves play an important role in our understanding of\nthe electronic structure of atoms and molecules. The simplest example of a standing wave is a one-\ndimensional wave associated with a vibrating string that is held fixed at its two end points. Figure 6.7 shows\nthe four lowest-energy standing waves (the fundamental wave and the lowest three harmonics) for a vibrating\nstring at a particular amplitude. Although the string's motion lies mostly within a plane, the wave itself is\nconsidered to be one dimensional, since it lies along the length of the string. The motion of string segments in\na direction perpendicular to the string length generates the waves and so the amplitude of the waves is visible\nas the maximum displacement of the curves seen in Figure 6.7. The key observation from the figure is that\nonly those waves having an integer number, n, of half-wavelengths between the end points can form. A system\nwith fixed end points such as this restricts the number and type of the possible waveforms. This is an example\nof quantization, in which only discrete values from a more general set of continuous values of some property\nare observed. Another important observation is that the harmonic waves (those waves displaying more than\none-half wavelength) all have one or more points between the two end points that are not in motion. These\nspecial points are nodes. The energies of the standing waves with a given amplitude in a vibrating string\nincrease with the number of half-wavelengths n. Since the number of nodes is n – 1, the energy can also be\nsaid to depend on the number of nodes, generally increasing as the number of nodes increases.\nFIGURE 6.7\nA vibrating string shows some one-dimensional standing waves. Since the two end points of the string\nare held fixed, only waves having an integer number of half-wavelengths can form. The points on the string between\nthe end points that are not moving are called the nodes.\nAn example of two-dimensional standing waves is shown in Figure 6.8, which shows the vibrational patterns\non a flat surface. Although the vibrational amplitudes cannot be seen like they could in the vibrating string, the\nnodes have been made visible by sprinkling the drum surface with a powder that collects on the areas of the\nsurface that have minimal displacement. For one-dimensional standing waves, the nodes were points on the\nline, but for two-dimensional standing waves, the nodes are lines on the surface (for three-dimensional\nstanding waves, the nodes are two-dimensional surfaces within the three-dimensional volume).\nFIGURE 6.8\nTwo-dimensional standing waves can be visualized on a vibrating surface.

This required obtaining a better understanding of the distributions of light\nemitted from various sources being considered. Artificial lighting is usually designed to mimic natural\nsunlight within the limitations of the underlying technology. Such lighting consists of a range of broadly\ndistributed frequencies that form a continuous spectrum. Figure 6.9 shows the wavelength distribution for\nsunlight. The most intense radiation is in the visible region, with the intensity dropping off rapidly for shorter\nwavelength ultraviolet (UV) light, and more slowly for longer wavelength infrared (IR) light.\nFIGURE 6.9\nThe spectral distribution (light intensity vs. wavelength) of sunlight reaches the Earth's atmosphere as\nUV light, visible light, and IR light. The unabsorbed sunlight at the top of the atmosphere has a distribution that\napproximately matches the theoretical distribution of a blackbody at 5250 °C, represented by the blue curve.\n(credit: modification of work by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Terrestrial Reference Spectra for\nPhotovoltaic Performance Evaluation)\nIn Figure 6.9, the solar distribution is compared to a representative distribution, called a blackbody spectrum,\nthat corresponds to a temperature of 5250 °C. The blackbody spectrum matches the solar spectrum quite well.\nA blackbody is a convenient, ideal emitter that approximates the behavior of many materials when heated. It\nis “ideal” in the same sense that an ideal gas is a convenient, simple representation of real gases that works\nwell, provided that the pressure is not too high nor the temperature too low. A good approximation of a\nblackbody that can be used to observe blackbody radiation is a metal oven that can be heated to very high\ntemperatures. The oven has a small hole allowing for the light being emitted within the oven to be observed\n264\n6 • Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Each distribution depends only on a single parameter:\nthe temperature. The maxima in the blackbody curves, λmax, shift to shorter wavelengths as the temperature\nincreases, reflecting the observation that metals being heated to high temperatures begin to glow a darker red\nthat becomes brighter as the temperature increases, eventually becoming white hot at very high temperatures\nas the intensities of all of the visible wavelengths become appreciable. This common observation was at the\nheart of the first paradox that showed the fundamental limitations of classical physics that we will examine.\nPhysicists derived mathematical expressions for the blackbody curves using well-accepted concepts from the\ntheories of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism. The theoretical expressions as functions of\ntemperature fit the observed experimental blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths, but showed\nsignificant discrepancies at shorter wavelengths. Not only did the theoretical curves not show a peak, they\nabsurdly showed the intensity becoming infinitely large as the wavelength became smaller, which would imply\nthat everyday objects at room temperature should be emitting large amounts of UV light. This became known\nas the “ultraviolet catastrophe” because no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment that\ncould lead to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior. Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a\ntheoretical expression for blackbody radiation that fit the experimental observations exactly (within\nexperimental error). Planck developed his theoretical treatment by extending the earlier work that had been\nbased on the premise that the atoms composing the oven vibrated at increasing frequencies (or decreasing\nwavelengths) as the temperature increased, with these vibrations being the source of the emitted\nelectromagnetic radiation. But where the earlier treatments had allowed the vibrating atoms to have any\nenergy values obtained from a continuous set of energies (perfectly reasonable, according to classical physics),\nPlanck found that by restricting the vibrational energies to discrete values for each frequency, he could derive\nan expression for blackbody radiation that correctly had the intensity dropping rapidly for the short\nwavelengths in the UV region.\nThe quantity h is a constant now known as Planck's constant, in his honor. Although Planck was pleased he\nhad resolved the blackbody radiation paradox, he was disturbed that to do so, he needed to assume the\nvibrating atoms required quantized energies, which he was unable to explain. The value of Planck's constant is\nvery small, 6.626\n10−34 joule seconds (J s), which helps explain why energy quantization had not been\nobserved previously in macroscopic phenomena.\nFIGURE 6.10\nBlackbody spectral distribution curves are shown for some representative temperatures.\n6.1 • Electromagnetic Energy\n265",

          "text": "The Photoelectric Effect\nThe next paradox in the classical theory to be resolved concerned the photoelectric effect (Figure 6.11). It had\nbeen observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency\ngreater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected\nelectrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light.\nSince the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light\nneeded to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends\non its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the\nnumber of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In\n1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the\ndiscredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of\nrelativity for which he is most famous).\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation\ncould be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be\nviewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their\nfrequency, according to Planck's formula, E = hν (or, in terms of wavelength using c = νλ,\n). Electrons\nwere ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The\ngreater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions.\nEinstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead\ncorresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the\nnumber of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming\nphotons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.\nWith Einstein's findings, the nature of light took on a new air of mystery. Although many light phenomena\ncould be explained either in terms of waves or particles, certain phenomena, such as the interference patterns\nobtained when light passed through a double slit, were completely contrary to a particle view of light, while\nother phenomena, such as the photoelectric effect, were completely contrary to a wave view of light. Somehow,\nat a deep fundamental level still not fully understood, light is both wavelike and particle-like. This is known as\nwave-particle duality.\nFIGURE 6.11\nPhotons with low frequencies do not have enough energy to cause electrons to be ejected via the\nphotoelectric effect. For any frequency of light above the threshold frequency, the kinetic energy of an ejected\nelectron will increase linearly with the energy of the incoming photon.\nEXAMPLE 6.2\nCalculating the Energy of Radiation\nWhen we see light from a neon sign, we are observing radiation from excited neon atoms.

When solids, liquids, or condensed\ngases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner\nhave a range of energies, and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of\nwavelengths is present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this fashion.\nYou can see all the visible wavelengths of light present in sunlight by using a prism to separate them. As can be\nseen in Figure 6.9, sunlight also contains UV light (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that\ncan be detected using instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such\nas tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all wavelengths of visible light.\nThese continuous spectra can often be approximated by blackbody radiation curves at some appropriate\ntemperature, such as those shown in Figure 6.10.\nIn contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra having very narrow line\nwidths interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as those shown in Figure 6.13. Exciting a gas at low\npartial pressure using an electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs and\nneon signs operate in this way (Figure 6.12). Each element displays its own characteristic set of lines, as do\nmolecules, although their spectra are generally much more complicated.\nFIGURE 6.12\nNeon signs operate by exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current.

This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a\nminiature “solar system” with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest\natom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The\nelectrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles.\nThis classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an\nelliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it\nshould continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron’s\norbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism’s\nprediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into\nthe classical mechanics description of the atom Planck’s ideas of quantization and Einstein’s finding that light\nconsists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting\nthe nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or\nabsorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the\norbital energies according to this equation:\nIn this equation, h is Planck’s constant and Ei and Ef are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The\nabsolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead\nof allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were\nquantized:\nIn this expression, k is a constant comprising fundamental constants such as the electron mass and charge\nand Planck’s constant. Inserting the expression for the orbit energies into the equation for ΔE gives\nor\nwhich is identical to the Rydberg equation in which\n∞\nWhen Bohr calculated his theoretical value for\nthe Rydberg constant,\n∞and compared it with the experimentally accepted value, he got excellent\nagreement. Since the Rydberg constant was one of the most precisely measured constants at that time, this\nlevel of agreement was astonishing and meant that Bohr’s model was taken seriously, despite the many\nassumptions that Bohr needed to derive it.\nThe lowest few energy levels are shown in Figure 6.14. One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is\nmost stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the n = 1\norbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\n270\n6 • Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

If the atom receives energy from an outside\nsource, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher n value and the atom is now in an\nexcited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from\nan excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted\nas a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a\nlower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned\npreviously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy.\nThus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another,\nthat same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 6.15).\nSince Bohr’s model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions He+, Li2+,\nBe3+, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and\nions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms. The energy expression for hydrogen-like atoms is a\ngeneralization of the hydrogen atom energy, in which Z is the nuclear charge (+1 for hydrogen, +2 for He, +3 for\nLi, and so on) and k has a value of 2.179\n10–18 J.\nThe sizes of the circular orbits for hydrogen-like atoms are given in terms of their radii by the following\nexpression, in which\nis a constant called the Bohr radius, with a value of 5.292\n10−11 m:\nThe equation also shows us that as the electron’s energy increases (as n increases), the electron is found at\ngreater distances from the nucleus.

A billiard ball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will\ncontinue in a straight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or is acted on by some other\nforce (such as friction). The ball has a well-defined position and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, p = mv,\ndefined by mass m and velocity v) at any given moment. In other words, the ball is moving in a classical\ntrajectory. This is the typical behavior of a classical object.\nWhen waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are not displayed by macroscopic\nparticles such as the billiard ball. For example, interacting waves on the surface of water can produce\ninterference patterns similar to those shown on Figure 6.16. This is a case of wave behavior on the\nmacroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are very different phenomena in the macroscopic\nrealm.\nFIGURE 6.16\nAn interference pattern on the water surface is formed by interacting waves. The waves are caused\nby reflection of water from the rocks.

The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the case for the\nmicroscopic world.\nOne of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the microscopic world was Louis de Broglie.\nHe asked the question: If electromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and other\nsubmicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoral dissertation, de Broglie extended\nthe wave–particle duality of light that Einstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material\nparticles. He predicted that a particle with mass m and velocity v (that is, with linear momentum p) should also\nexhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value λ, given by this expression in which h is the familiar\nPlanck’s constant:\nThis is called the de Broglie wavelength. Unlike the other values of λ discussed in this chapter, the de Broglie\nwavelength is a characteristic of particles and other bodies, not electromagnetic radiation (note that this\nequation involves velocity [v, m/s], not frequency [ν, Hz]. Although these two symbols appear nearly identical,\nthey mean very different things). Where Bohr had postulated the electron as being a particle orbiting the\nnucleus in quantized orbits, de Broglie argued that Bohr’s assumption of quantization can be explained if the\nelectron is considered not as a particle, but rather as a circular standing wave such that only an integer\nnumber of wavelengths could fit exactly within the orbit (Figure 6.17).\n6.3 • Development of Quantum Theory\n275",

The regularly spaced\natomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers\nserving as slits needs to be similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to\nform, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their “slits,” since the spacing of the atoms\nwithin the lattice was approximately the same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used.\nFigure 6.18 shows an interference pattern. It is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in\nElectromagnetic Energy for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The wave–particle duality of\nmatter can be seen in Figure 6.18 by observing what happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long\nperiod of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior,\nhaving arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random.

When Schrödinger\napplied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr’s expression for the energy and,\nthus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional\nstationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, ψ.

The\nsquare of the magnitude of a wavefunction\ndescribes the probability of the quantum particle being\npresent near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the\ndistribution of the electron’s density with respect to the nucleus in an atom. In the most general form, the\nSchrödinger equation can be written as:\nis the Hamiltonian operator, a set of mathematical operations representing the total energy of the quantum\nparticle (such as an electron in an atom), ψ is the wavefunction of this particle that can be used to find the\nspecial distribution of the probability of finding the particle, and\nis the actual value of the total energy of the\nparticle.\nSchrödinger’s work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists following in their footsteps, is\ngenerally referred to as quantum mechanics.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nYou may also have heard of Schrödinger because of his famous thought experiment. This story\n(http://openstax.org/l/16superpos) explains the concepts of superposition and entanglement as related to a cat\nin a box with poison.\nUnderstanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms\nThe goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons in atoms), their different\nenergies, and other properties. The use of quantum theory provides the best understanding to these topics.\nThis knowledge is a precursor to chemical bonding.\nAs was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energy levels but not between them.\nIt is said that the energy of an electron in an atom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific\nvalues and can jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or stay between these levels.\nThe energy levels are labeled with an n value, where n = 1, 2, 3, …. Generally speaking, the energy of an\nelectron in an atom is greater for greater values of n. This number, n, is referred to as the principal quantum\nnumber. The principal quantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially the same\nconcept as the n in the Bohr atom description. Another name for the principal quantum number is the shell\nnumber. The shells of an atom can be thought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The\nelectrons that belong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the corresponding circular area. The\nfurther we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shell number, and so the higher the energy level (Figure\n6.19). The positively charged protons in the nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attraction\n6.3 • Development of Quantum Theory\n279",

So the further away the\nelectron is from the nucleus, the greater the energy it has.\nFIGURE 6.19\nDifferent shells are numbered by principal quantum numbers.\nThis quantum mechanical model for where electrons reside in an atom can be used to look at electronic\ntransitions, the events when an electron moves from one energy level to another. If the transition is to a higher\nenergy level, energy is absorbed, and the energy change has a positive value. To obtain the amount of energy\nnecessary for the transition to a higher energy level, a photon is absorbed by the atom. A transition to a lower\nenergy level involves a release of energy, and the energy change is negative. This process is accompanied by\nemission of a photon by the atom. The following equation summarizes these relationships and is based on the\nhydrogen atom:\nThe values nf and ni are the final and initial energy states of the electron. Example 6.5 in the previous section\nof the chapter demonstrates calculations of such energy changes.\nThe principal quantum number is one of three quantum numbers used to characterize an orbital. An atomic\norbital is a general region in an atom within which an electron is most probable to reside. The quantum\nmechanical model specifies the probability of finding an electron in the three-dimensional space around the\nnucleus and is based on solutions of the Schrödinger equation. In addition, the principal quantum number\ndefines the energy of an electron in a hydrogen or hydrogen-like atom or an ion (an atom or an ion with only\none electron) and the general region in which discrete energy levels of electrons in a multi-electron atoms and\nions are located.\nAnother quantum number is l, the secondary (angular momentum) quantum number. It is an integer that\nmay take the values, l = 0, 1, 2, …, n – 1. This means that an orbital with n = 1 can have only one value of l, l = 0,\nwhereas n = 2 permits l = 0 and l = 1, and so on. Whereas the principal quantum number, n, defines the general\nsize and energy of the orbital, the secondary quantum number l specifies the shape of the orbital. Orbitals with\nthe same value of l define a subshell.\nOrbitals with l = 0 are called s orbitals and they make up the s subshells. The value l = 1 corresponds to the p\norbitals. For a given n, p orbitals constitute a p subshell (e.g., 3p if n = 3). The orbitals with l = 2 are called the d\norbitals, followed by the f-, g-, and h-orbitals for l = 3, 4, and 5.\nThere are certain distances from the nucleus at which the probability density of finding an electron located at a\nparticular orbital is zero. In other words, the value of the wavefunction ψ is zero at this distance for this orbital.\nSuch a value of radius r is called a radial node. The number of radial nodes in an orbital is n – l – 1.\n280\n6 • Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

The number before the orbital name (such as 2s,\n3p, and so forth) stands for the principal quantum number, n. The letter in the orbital name defines the\nsubshell with a specific angular momentum quantum number l = 0 for s orbitals, 1 for p orbitals, 2 for d\norbitals. Finally, there are more than one possible orbitals for l ≥ 1, each corresponding to a specific value of\nml. In the case of a hydrogen atom or a one-electron ion (such as He+, Li2+, and so on), energies of all the\norbitals with the same n are the same. This is called a degeneracy, and the energy levels for the same principal\nquantum number, n, are called degenerate orbitals. However, in atoms with more than one electron, this\ndegeneracy is eliminated by the electron–electron interactions, and orbitals that belong to different subshells\nhave different energies, as shown on Figure 6.22. Orbitals within the same subshell are still degenerate and\nhave the same energy.\nWhile the three quantum numbers discussed in the previous paragraphs work well for describing electron\norbitals, some experiments showed that they were not sufficient to explain all observed results. It was\ndemonstrated in the 1920s that when hydrogen-line spectra are examined at extremely high resolution, some\nlines are actually not single peaks but, rather, pairs of closely spaced lines. This is the so-called fine structure\nof the spectrum, and it implies that there are additional small differences in energies of electrons even when\nthey are located in the same orbital. These observations led Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck to\npropose that electrons have a fourth quantum number. They called this the spin quantum number, or ms.\nThe other three quantum numbers, n, l, and ml, are properties of specific atomic orbitals that also define in\nwhat part of the space an electron is most likely to be located. Orbitals are a result of solving the Schrödinger\nequation for electrons in atoms. The electron spin is a different kind of property. It is a completely quantum\nphenomenon with no analogues in the classical realm. In addition, it cannot be derived from solving the\nSchrödinger equation and is not related to the normal spatial coordinates (such as the Cartesian x, y, and z).\nElectron spin describes an intrinsic electron \"rotation\" or \"spinning.\" Each electron acts as a tiny magnet or a\ntiny rotating object with an angular momentum, or as a loop with an electric current, even though this rotation\nor current cannot be observed in terms of spatial coordinates.\nThe magnitude of the overall electron spin can only have one value, and an electron can only “spin” in one of\ntwo quantized states. One is termed the α state, with the z component of the spin being in the positive direction\nof the z axis. This corresponds to the spin quantum number\nThe other is called the β state, with the\nz component of the spin being negative and\nAny electron, regardless of the atomic orbital it is\nlocated in, can only have one of those two values of the spin quantum number.

This is true\neven for an electron occupying the same orbital in an atom. A spectral line corresponding to a transition for\nelectrons from the same orbital but with different spin quantum numbers has two possible values of energy;\nthus, the line in the spectrum will show a fine structure splitting.\nThe Pauli Exclusion Principle\nAn electron in an atom is completely described by four quantum numbers: n, l, ml, and ms. The first three\nquantum numbers define the orbital and the fourth quantum number describes the intrinsic electron property\ncalled spin. An Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated a general principle that gives the last piece of\ninformation that we need to understand the general behavior of electrons in atoms. The Pauli exclusion\nprinciple can be formulated as follows: No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of all\nthe four quantum numbers. What this means is that two electrons can share the same orbital (the same set of\nthe quantum numbers n, l, and ml) only if their spin quantum numbers ms have different values. Since the spin\nquantum number can only have two values\nno more than two electrons can occupy the same orbital\n(and if two electrons are located in the same orbital, they must have opposite spins). Therefore, any atomic\norbital can be populated by only zero, one, or two electrons.\nThe properties and meaning of the quantum numbers of electrons in atoms are briefly summarized in Table\n6.1.\nQuantum Numbers, Their Properties, and Significance\nName\nSymbol\nAllowed\nvalues\nPhysical meaning\nprincipal quantum number\nn\n1, 2, 3, 4,\n….\nshell, the general region for the value of energy\nfor an electron on the orbital\nangular momentum or\nazimuthal quantum number\nl\n0 ≤l ≤n\n– 1\nsubshell, the shape of the orbital\nmagnetic quantum number\nml\n– l ≤ml ≤\nl\norientation of the orbital\n284\n6 • Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

This allows us to determine which\norbitals are occupied by electrons in each atom. The specific arrangement of electrons in orbitals of an atom\ndetermines many of the chemical properties of that atom.\nOrbital Energies and Atomic Structure\nThe energy of atomic orbitals increases as the principal quantum number, n, increases. In any atom with two\nor more electrons, the repulsion between the electrons makes energies of subshells with different values of l\ndiffer so that the energy of the orbitals increases within a shell in the order s < p < d < f. Figure 6.24 depicts\nhow these two trends in increasing energy relate. The 1s orbital at the bottom of the diagram is the orbital with\nelectrons of lowest energy. The energy increases as we move up to the 2s and then 2p, 3s, and 3p orbitals,\nshowing that the increasing n value has more influence on energy than the increasing l value for small atoms.\nHowever, this pattern does not hold for larger atoms. The 3d orbital is higher in energy than the 4s orbital.\nSuch overlaps continue to occur frequently as we move up the chart.\nFIGURE 6.24\nGeneralized energy-level diagram for atomic orbitals in an atom with two or more electrons (not to\nscale).\nElectrons in successive atoms on the periodic table tend to fill low-energy orbitals first. Thus, many students\nfind it confusing that, for example, the 5p orbitals fill immediately after the 4d, and immediately before the 6s.\nThe filling order is based on observed experimental results, and has been confirmed by theoretical\ncalculations. As the principal quantum number, n, increases, the size of the orbital increases and the electrons\nspend more time farther from the nucleus. Thus, the attraction to the nucleus is weaker and the energy\nassociated with the orbital is higher (less stabilized). But this is not the only effect we have to take into account.\nWithin each shell, as the value of l increases, the electrons are less penetrating (meaning there is less electron\ndensity found close to the nucleus), in the order s > p > d > f. Electrons that are closer to the nucleus slightly\nrepel electrons that are farther out, offsetting the more dominant electron–nucleus attractions slightly (recall\n6.4 • Electronic Structure of Atoms (Electron Configurations)\n287",

Electrons in orbitals that experience more shielding are less\nstabilized and thus higher in energy. For small orbitals (1s through 3p), the increase in energy due to n is more\nsignificant than the increase due to l; however, for larger orbitals the two trends are comparable and cannot be\nsimply predicted. We will discuss methods for remembering the observed order.\nThe arrangement of electrons in the orbitals of an atom is called the electron configuration of the atom. We\ndescribe an electron configuration with a symbol that contains three pieces of information (Figure 6.25):\n1.\nThe number of the principal quantum shell, n,\n2.\nThe letter that designates the orbital type (the subshell, l), and\n3.\nA superscript number that designates the number of electrons in that particular subshell.\nFor example, the notation 2p4 (read \"two–p–four\") indicates four electrons in a p subshell (l = 1) with a\nprincipal quantum number (n) of 2. The notation 3d8 (read \"three–d–eight\") indicates eight electrons in the d\nsubshell (i.e., l = 2) of the principal shell for which n = 3.\nFIGURE 6.25\nThe diagram of an electron configuration specifies the subshell (n and l value, with letter symbol) and\nsuperscript number of electrons.\nThe Aufbau Principle\nTo determine the electron configuration for any particular atom, we can “build” the structures in the order of\natomic numbers. Beginning with hydrogen, and continuing across the periods of the periodic table, we add one\nproton at a time to the nucleus and one electron to the proper subshell until we have described the electron\nconfigurations of all the elements. This procedure is called the Aufbau principle, from the German word\nAufbau (“to build up”). Each added electron occupies the subshell of lowest energy available (in the order\nshown in Figure 6.24), subject to the limitations imposed by the allowed quantum numbers according to the\nPauli exclusion principle. Electrons enter higher-energy subshells only after lower-energy subshells have been\nfilled to capacity. Figure 6.26 illustrates the traditional way to remember the filling order for atomic orbitals.\nSince the arrangement of the periodic table is based on the electron configurations, Figure 6.27 provides an\nalternative method for determining the electron configuration. The filling order simply begins at hydrogen and\nincludes each subshell as you proceed in increasing Z order. For example, after filling the 3p block up to Ar, we\nsee the orbital will be 4s (K, Ca), followed by the 3d orbitals.\nFIGURE 6.26\nThis diagram depicts the energy order for atomic orbitals and is useful for deriving ground-state\nelectron configurations.\n288\n6 • Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

However, all available chemical and\nphysical evidence indicates that potassium is like lithium and sodium, and that the next electron is not added\nto the 3d level but is, instead, added to the 4s level (Figure 6.29). As discussed previously, the 3d orbital with no\nradial nodes is higher in energy because it is less penetrating and more shielded from the nucleus than the 4s,\nwhich has three radial nodes. Thus, potassium has an electron configuration of [Ar]4s1. Hence, potassium\ncorresponds to Li and Na in its valence shell configuration. The next electron is added to complete the 4s\nsubshell and calcium has an electron configuration of [Ar]4s2.

The 15 electrons of the phosphorus atom will fill up to the 3p\norbital, which will contain three electrons:\nThe last electron added is a 3p electron.

However, we\ndo find exceptions to the order of filling of orbitals that are shown in Figure 6.26 or Figure 6.27. For instance,\nthe electron configurations (shown in Figure 6.29) of the transition metals chromium (Cr; atomic number 24)\nand copper (Cu; atomic number 29), among others, are not those we would expect. In general, such exceptions\ninvolve subshells with very similar energy, and small effects can lead to changes in the order of filling.\nIn the case of Cr and Cu, we find that half-filled and completely filled subshells apparently represent conditions\nof preferred stability. This stability is such that an electron shifts from the 4s into the 3d orbital to gain the\nextra stability of a half-filled 3d subshell (in Cr) or a filled 3d subshell (in Cu). Other exceptions also occur. For\nexample, niobium (Nb, atomic number 41) is predicted to have the electron configuration [Kr]5s24d3.\nExperimentally, we observe that its ground-state electron configuration is actually [Kr]5s14d4. We can\nrationalize this observation by saying that the electron–electron repulsions experienced by pairing the\nelectrons in the 5s orbital are larger than the gap in energy between the 5s and 4d orbitals. There is no simple\nmethod to predict the exceptions for atoms where the magnitude of the repulsions between electrons is\ngreater than the small differences in energy between subshells.\nElectron Configurations and the Periodic Table\nAs described earlier, the periodic table arranges atoms based on increasing atomic number so that elements\nwith the same chemical properties recur periodically. When their electron configurations are added to the\ntable (Figure 6.29), we also see a periodic recurrence of similar electron configurations in the outer shells of\nthese elements. Because they are in the outer shells of an atom, valence electrons play the most important role\nin chemical reactions. The outer electrons have the highest energy of the electrons in an atom and are more\neasily lost or shared than the core electrons. Valence electrons are also the determining factor in some\nphysical properties of the elements.\nElements in any one group (or column) have the same number of valence electrons; the alkali metals lithium\n6.4 • Electronic Structure of Atoms (Electron Configurations)\n293",

The similarity in chemical\nproperties among elements of the same group occurs because they have the same number of valence\nelectrons. It is the loss, gain, or sharing of valence electrons that defines how elements react.\nIt is important to remember that the periodic table was developed on the basis of the chemical behavior of the\nelements, well before any idea of their atomic structure was available. Now we can understand why the\nperiodic table has the arrangement it has—the arrangement puts elements whose atoms have the same\nnumber of valence electrons in the same group. This arrangement is emphasized in Figure 6.29, which shows\nin periodic-table form the electron configuration of the last subshell to be filled by the Aufbau principle. The\ncolored sections of Figure 6.29 show the three categories of elements classified by the orbitals being filled:\nmain group, transition, and inner transition elements. These classifications determine which orbitals are\ncounted in the valence shell, or highest energy level orbitals of an atom.\n1.\nMain group elements (sometimes called representative elements) are those in which the last electron\nadded enters an s or a p orbital in the outermost shell, shown in blue and red in Figure 6.29. This category\nincludes all the nonmetallic elements, as well as many metals and the metalloids. The valence electrons\nfor main group elements are those with the highest n level. For example, gallium (Ga, atomic number 31)\nhas the electron configuration [Ar]4s23d104p1, which contains three valence electrons (underlined). The\ncompletely filled d orbitals count as core, not valence, electrons.\n2.\nTransition elements or transition metals. These are metallic elements in which the last electron added\nenters a d orbital. The valence electrons (those added after the last noble gas configuration) in these\nelements include the ns and (n – 1) d electrons. The official IUPAC definition of transition elements\nspecifies those with partially filled d orbitals. Thus, the elements with completely filled orbitals (Zn, Cd,\nHg, as well as Cu, Ag, and Au in Figure 6.29) are not technically transition elements. However, the term is\nfrequently used to refer to the entire d block (colored yellow in Figure 6.29), and we will adopt this usage in\nthis textbook.\n3.\nInner transition elements are metallic elements in which the last electron added occupies an f orbital.\nThey are shown in green in Figure 6.29. The valence shells of the inner transition elements consist of the\n(n – 2)f, the (n – 1)d, and the ns subshells. There are two inner transition series:\na.\nThe lanthanide series: lanthanum (La) through lutetium (Lu)\nb.\nThe actinide series: actinium (Ac) through lawrencium (Lr)\nLanthanum and actinium, because of their similarities to the other members of the series, are included and\nused to name the series, even though they are transition metals with no f electrons.\nElectron Configurations of Ions\nIons are formed when atoms gain or lose electrons. A cation (positively charged ion) forms when one or more\nelectrons are removed from a parent atom. For main group elements, the electrons that were added last are\nthe first electrons removed. For transition metals and inner transition metals, however, electrons in the\ns orbital are easier to remove than the d or f electrons, and so the highest ns electrons are lost, and then the\n(n – 1)d or (n – 2)f electrons are removed. An anion (negatively charged ion) forms when one or more\nelectrons are added to a parent atom. The added electrons fill in the order predicted by the Aufbau principle.\nEXAMPLE 6.11\nPredicting Electron Configurations of Ions\nWhat is the electron configuration of:\n(a) Na+\n(b) P3–\n(c) Al2+\n(d) Fe2+\n294\n6 • Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

This\nsimilarity occurs because the members of a group have the same number and distribution of electrons in their\nvalence shells. However, there are also other patterns in chemical properties on the periodic table. For\nexample, as we move down a group, the metallic character of the atoms increases. Oxygen, at the top of group\n16 (6A), is a colorless gas; in the middle of the group, selenium is a semiconducting solid; and, toward the\nbottom, polonium is a silver-grey solid that conducts electricity.\nAs we go across a period from left to right, we add a proton to the nucleus and an electron to the valence shell\nwith each successive element. As we go down the elements in a group, the number of electrons in the valence\nshell remains constant, but the principal quantum number increases by one each time. An understanding of\nthe electronic structure of the elements allows us to examine some of the properties that govern their chemical\nbehavior. These properties vary periodically as the electronic structure of the elements changes. They are (1)\nsize (radius) of atoms and ions, (2) ionization energies, and (3) electron affinities.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nExplore visualizations (http://openstax.org/l/16pertrends) of the periodic trends discussed in this section (and\nmany more trends).

          "text": "Variation in Covalent Radius\nThe quantum mechanical picture makes it difficult to establish a definite size of an atom. However, there are\nseveral practical ways to define the radius of atoms and, thus, to determine their relative sizes that give roughly\nsimilar values. We will use the covalent radius (Figure 6.30), which is defined as one-half the distance between\nthe nuclei of two identical atoms when they are joined by a covalent bond (this measurement is possible\nbecause atoms within molecules still retain much of their atomic identity). We know that as we scan down a\ngroup, the principal quantum number, n, increases by one for each element. Thus, the electrons are being\nadded to a region of space that is increasingly distant from the nucleus. Consequently, the size of the atom (and\nits covalent radius) must increase as we increase the distance of the outermost electrons from the nucleus.\nThis trend is illustrated for the covalent radii of the halogens in Table 6.2 and Figure 6.30.

          "text": "FIGURE 6.31\nWithin each period, the trend in atomic radius decreases as Z increases; for example, from K to Kr.\nWithin each group (e.g., the alkali metals shown in purple), the trend is that atomic radius increases as Z increases.\nAs shown in Figure 6.31, as we move across a period from left to right, we generally find that each element has\na smaller covalent radius than the element preceding it. This might seem counterintuitive because it implies\nthat atoms with more electrons have a smaller atomic radius. This can be explained with the concept of\neffective nuclear charge, Zeff. This is the pull exerted on a specific electron by the nucleus, taking into\naccount any electron–electron repulsions. For hydrogen, there is only one electron and so the nuclear charge\n(Z) and the effective nuclear charge (Zeff) are equal. For all other atoms, the inner electrons partially shield the\nouter electrons from the pull of the nucleus, and thus:\nShielding is determined by the probability of another electron being between the electron of interest and the\nnucleus, as well as by the electron–electron repulsions the electron of interest encounters. Core electrons are\nadept at shielding, while electrons in the same valence shell do not block the nuclear attraction experienced by\neach other as efficiently. Thus, each time we move from one element to the next across a period, Z increases by\none, but the shielding increases only slightly. Thus, Zeff increases as we move from left to right across a period.\nThe stronger pull (higher effective nuclear charge) experienced by electrons on the right side of the periodic\ntable draws them closer to the nucleus, making the covalent radii smaller.\nThus, as we would expect, the outermost or valence electrons are easiest to remove because they have the\nhighest energies, are shielded more, and are farthest from the nucleus. As a general rule, when the\nrepresentative elements form cations, they do so by the loss of the ns or np electrons that were added last in\nthe Aufbau process. The transition elements, on the other hand, lose the ns electrons before they begin to lose\nthe (n – 1)d electrons, even though the ns electrons are added first, according to the Aufbau principle.\n298\n6 • Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Radius decreases as we move across a period, so Kr < Br < Ge. Putting the trends together, we obtain\nKr < Br < Ge < Fl.\nCheck Your Learning\nGive an example of an atom whose size is smaller than fluorine.\nAnswer:\nNe or He\nVariation in Ionic Radii\nIonic radius is the measure used to describe the size of an ion. A cation always has fewer electrons and the\nsame number of protons as the parent atom; it is smaller than the atom from which it is derived (Figure 6.32).\nFor example, the covalent radius of an aluminum atom (1s22s22p63s23p1) is 118 pm, whereas the ionic radius\nof an Al3+ (1s22s22p6) is 68 pm. As electrons are removed from the outer valence shell, the remaining core\nelectrons occupying smaller shells experience a greater effective nuclear charge Zeff (as discussed) and are\ndrawn even closer to the nucleus.\nFIGURE 6.32\nThe radius for a cation is smaller than the parent atom (Al), due to the lost electrons; the radius for\nan anion is larger than the parent (S), due to the gained electrons.\nCations with larger charges are smaller than cations with smaller charges (e.g., V2+ has an ionic radius of 79\npm, while that of V3+ is 64 pm). Proceeding down the groups of the periodic table, we find that cations of\nsuccessive elements with the same charge generally have larger radii, corresponding to an increase in the\nprincipal quantum number, n.\nAn anion (negative ion) is formed by the addition of one or more electrons to the valence shell of an atom. This\nresults in a greater repulsion among the electrons and a decrease in Zeff per electron. Both effects (the\nincreased number of electrons and the decreased Zeff) cause the radius of an anion to be larger than that of the\nparent atom (Figure 6.32). For example, a sulfur atom ([Ne]3s23p4) has a covalent radius of 104 pm, whereas\nthe ionic radius of the sulfide anion ([Ne]3s23p6) is 170 pm. For consecutive elements proceeding down any\ngroup, anions have larger principal quantum numbers and, thus, larger radii.\nAtoms and ions that have the same electron configuration are said to be isoelectronic. Examples of\nisoelectronic species are N3–, O2–, F–, Ne, Na+, Mg2+, and Al3+ (1s22s22p6). Another isoelectronic series is P3–,\nS2–, Cl–, Ar, K+, Ca2+, and Sc3+ ([Ne]3s23p6). For atoms or ions that are isoelectronic, the number of protons\ndetermines the size. The greater the nuclear charge, the smaller the radius in a series of isoelectronic ions and\natoms.\nVariation in Ionization Energies\nThe amount of energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron from a gaseous atom in its ground\nstate is called its first ionization energy (IE1). The first ionization energy for an element, X, is the energy\nrequired to form a cation with +1 charge:\n6.5 • Periodic Variations in Element Properties\n299",

Energy is always\nrequired to remove electrons from atoms or ions, so ionization processes are endothermic and IE values are\nalways positive. For larger atoms, the most loosely bound electron is located farther from the nucleus and so is\neasier to remove. Thus, as size (atomic radius) increases, the ionization energy should decrease. Relating this\nlogic to what we have just learned about radii, we would expect first ionization energies to decrease down a\ngroup and to increase across a period.\nFigure 6.33 graphs the relationship between the first ionization energy and the atomic number of several\nelements. The values of first ionization energy for the elements are given in Figure 6.34. Within a period, the\nIE1 generally increases with increasing Z. Down a group, the IE1 value generally decreases with increasing Z.\nThere are some systematic deviations from this trend, however. Note that the ionization energy of boron\n(atomic number 5) is less than that of beryllium (atomic number 4) even though the nuclear charge of boron is\ngreater by one proton. This can be explained because the energy of the subshells increases as l increases, due\nto penetration and shielding (as discussed previously in this chapter). Within any one shell, the s electrons are\nlower in energy than the p electrons. This means that an s electron is harder to remove from an atom than a p\nelectron in the same shell. The electron removed during the ionization of beryllium ([He]2s2) is an s electron,\nwhereas the electron removed during the ionization of boron ([He]2s22p1) is a p electron; this results in a lower\nfirst ionization energy for boron, even though its nuclear charge is greater by one proton.

Looking at the\norbital diagram of oxygen, we can see that removing one electron will eliminate the electron–electron\nrepulsion caused by pairing the electrons in the 2p orbital and will result in a half-filled orbital (which is\nenergetically favorable). Analogous changes occur in succeeding periods (note the dip for sulfur after\nphosphorus in Figure 6.34).\nRemoving an electron from a cation is more difficult than removing an electron from a neutral atom because of\nthe greater electrostatic attraction to the cation. Likewise, removing an electron from a cation with a higher\npositive charge is more difficult than removing an electron from an ion with a lower charge.

You can see that many of these elements have negative values of EA, which\nmeans that energy is released when the gaseous atom accepts an electron. However, for some elements,\nenergy is required for the atom to become negatively charged and the value of their EA is positive. Just as with\nionization energy, subsequent EA values are associated with forming ions with more charge. The second EA is\nthe energy associated with adding an electron to an anion to form a –2 ion, and so on.\nAs we might predict, it becomes easier to add an electron across a series of atoms as the effective nuclear\ncharge of the atoms increases. We find, as we go from left to right across a period, EAs tend to become more\nnegative. The exceptions found among the elements of group 2 (2A), group 15 (5A), and group 18 (8A) can be\nunderstood based on the electronic structure of these groups. The noble gases, group 18 (8A), have a\ncompletely filled shell and the incoming electron must be added to a higher n level, which is more difficult to\ndo. Group 2 (2A) has a filled ns subshell, and so the next electron added goes into the higher energy np, so,\nagain, the observed EA value is not as the trend would predict. Finally, group 15 (5A) has a half-filled np\nsubshell and the next electron must be paired with an existing np electron. In all of these cases, the initial\nrelative stability of the electron configuration disrupts the trend in EA.\nWe also might expect the atom at the top of each group to have the most negative EA; their first ionization\npotentials suggest that these atoms have the largest effective nuclear charges. However, as we move down a\ngroup, we see that the second element in the group most often has the most negative EA. This can be attributed\n302\n6 • Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

For example, chlorine,\nwith an EA value of –348 kJ/mol, has the highest value of any element in the periodic table. The EA of fluorine\nis –322 kJ/mol. When we add an electron to a fluorine atom to form a fluoride anion (F–), we add an electron to\nthe n = 2 shell. The electron is attracted to the nucleus, but there is also significant repulsion from the other\nelectrons already present in this small valence shell. The chlorine atom has the same electron configuration in\nthe valence shell, but because the entering electron is going into the n = 3 shell, it occupies a considerably\nlarger region of space and the electron–electron repulsions are reduced. The entering electron does not\nexperience as much repulsion and the chlorine atom accepts an additional electron more readily, resulting in a\nmore negative EA.\nFIGURE 6.35\nThis version of the periodic table displays the electron affinity values (in kJ/mol) for selected\nelements.\nThe properties discussed in this section (size of atoms and ions, effective nuclear charge, ionization energies,\nand electron affinities) are central to understanding chemical reactivity. For example, because fluorine has an\nenergetically favorable EA and a large energy barrier to ionization (IE), it is much easier to form fluorine\nanions than cations. Metallic properties including conductivity and malleability (the ability to be formed into\nsheets) depend on having electrons that can be removed easily. Thus, metallic character increases as we move\ndown a group and decreases across a period in the same trend observed for atomic size because it is easier to\nremove an electron that is farther away from the nucleus.\n6.5 • Periodic Variations in Element Properties\n303",

This radiation shows wavelike\nbehavior, which can be characterized by a frequency,\nν, and a wavelength, λ, such that c = λν. Light is an\nexample of a travelling wave. Other important wave\nphenomena include standing waves, periodic\noscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit\nquantization, since their wavelengths are limited to\ndiscrete integer multiples of some characteristic\nlengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes\nthrough two closely spaced narrow slits having\ndimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will\nshow an interference pattern that is a result of\nconstructive and destructive interference of the\nwaves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates\nproperties of particles called photons. The energy of\na photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively,\nthe wavelength) of the radiation as E = hν (or\n), where h is Planck's constant. That light\ndemonstrates both wavelike and particle-like\nbehavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms\nof electromagnetic radiation share these properties,\nalthough various forms including X-rays, visible\nlight, microwaves, and radio waves interact\ndifferently with matter and have very different\npractical applications.

          "text": "be either continuous (incandescent sources like the\nsun) or discrete (from specific types of excited\natoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions\nthat can be approximated as blackbody radiation at\nsome appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of\nhydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism.\nThis line spectrum was simple enough that an\nempirical formula called the Rydberg formula could\nbe derived from the spectrum. Three historically\nimportant paradoxes from the late 19th and early\n20th centuries that could not be explained within\nthe existing framework of classical mechanics and\nclassical electromagnetism were the blackbody\nproblem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete\nspectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes\nultimately led to quantum theories that superseded\nthe classical theories.\n6.2 The Bohr Model\nBohr incorporated Planck’s and Einstein’s\nquantization ideas into a model of the hydrogen\natom that resolved the paradox of atom stability and\ndiscrete spectra. The Bohr model of the hydrogen\natom explains the connection between the\nquantization of photons and the quantized emission\nfrom atoms. Bohr described the hydrogen atom in\nterms of an electron moving in a circular orbit about\na nucleus. He postulated that the electron was\nrestricted to certain orbits characterized by discrete\nenergies. Transitions between these allowed orbits\nresult in the absorption or emission of photons.\nWhen an electron moves from a higher-energy orbit\nto a more stable one, energy is emitted in the form of\na photon. To move an electron from a stable orbit to\na more excited one, a photon of energy must be\nabsorbed. Using the Bohr model, we can calculate\nthe energy of an electron and the radius of its orbit\nin any one-electron system.\n6.3 Development of Quantum Theory\nMacroscopic objects act as particles. Microscopic\nobjects (such as electrons) have properties of both a\nparticle and a wave. Their exact trajectories cannot\nbe determined. The quantum mechanical model of\natoms describes the three-dimensional position of\nthe electron in a probabilistic manner according to a\nmathematical function called a wavefunction, often\ndenoted as ψ. Atomic wavefunctions are also called\norbitals. The squared magnitude of the wavefunction\ndescribes the distribution of the probability of\nfinding the electron in a particular region in space.\nTherefore, atomic orbitals describe the areas in an\natom where electrons are most likely to be found.\nAn atomic orbital is characterized by three quantum\nnumbers. The principal quantum number, n, can be\nany positive integer. The general region for value of\nenergy of the orbital and the average distance of an\nelectron from the nucleus are related to n. Orbitals\nhaving the same value of n are said to be in the same\nshell. The secondary (angular momentum) quantum\nnumber, l, can have any integer value from 0 to n – 1.\nThis quantum number describes the shape or type\nof the orbital. Orbitals with the same principal\nquantum number and the same l value belong to the\nsame subshell. The magnetic quantum number, ml,\nwith 2l + 1 values ranging from –l to +l, describes the\norientation of the orbital in space. In addition, each\nelectron has a spin quantum number, ms, that can\nbe equal to\nNo two electrons in the same atom\ncan have the same set of values for all the four\nquantum numbers.\n6.4 Electronic Structure of Atoms (Electron\nConfigurations)\nThe relative energy of the subshells determine the\norder in which atomic orbitals are filled (1s, 2s, 2p,\n3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, and so on). Electron configurations\nand orbital diagrams can be determined by applying\nthe Pauli exclusion principle (no two electrons can\nhave the same set of four quantum numbers) and\nHund’s rule (whenever possible, electrons retain\nunpaired spins in degenerate orbitals).\nElectrons in the outermost orbitals, called valence\nelectrons, are responsible for most of the chemical\nbehavior of elements. In the periodic table, elements\nwith analogous valence electron configurations\nusually occur within the same group. There are\nsome exceptions to the predicted filling order,\nparticularly when half-filled or completely filled\norbitals can be formed. The periodic table can be\ndivided into three categories based on the orbital in\nwhich the last electron to be added is placed: main\ngroup elements (s and p orbitals), transition\nelements (d orbitals), and inner transition elements\n(f orbitals).\n6.5 Periodic Variations in Element\nProperties\nElectron configurations allow us to understand\nmany periodic trends. Covalent radius increases as\nwe move down a group because the n level (orbital\nsize) increases. Covalent radius mostly decreases as\nwe move left to right across a period because the\neffective nuclear charge experienced by the\n306\n6 • Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Anionic radii are larger than\nthe parent atom, while cationic radii are smaller,\nbecause the number of valence electrons has\nchanged while the nuclear charge has remained\nconstant.

Electron affinity (the energy associated with\nforming an anion) is more favorable (exothermic)\nwhen electrons are placed into lower energy orbitals,\ncloser to the nucleus.

But it was not until 1985 that a new form of carbon was recognized:\nbuckminsterfullerene. This molecule was named after the architect and inventor R. Buckminster Fuller\n(1895–1983), whose signature architectural design was the geodesic dome, characterized by a lattice shell\nstructure supporting a spherical surface. Experimental evidence revealed the formula, C60, and then scientists\ndetermined how 60 carbon atoms could form one symmetric, stable molecule. They were guided by bonding\ntheory—the topic of this chapter—which explains how individual atoms connect to form more complex\nstructures.\n7.1 Ionic Bonding\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the formation of cations, anions, and ionic compounds\n•\nPredict the charge of common metallic and nonmetallic elements, and write their electron configurations\nFigure 7.1\nNicknamed “buckyballs,” buckminsterfullerene molecules (C60) contain only carbon atoms (left)\narranged to form a geometric framework of hexagons and pentagons, similar to the pattern on a soccer ball (center).\nThis molecular structure is named after architect R.

          "text": "As you have learned, ions are atoms or molecules bearing an electrical charge. A cation (a positive ion) forms\nwhen a neutral atom loses one or more electrons from its valence shell, and an anion (a negative ion) forms\nwhen a neutral atom gains one or more electrons in its valence shell.\nCompounds composed of ions are called ionic compounds (or salts), and their constituent ions are held\ntogether by ionic bonds: electrostatic forces of attraction between oppositely charged cations and anions. The\nproperties of ionic compounds shed some light on the nature of ionic bonds. Ionic solids exhibit a crystalline\nstructure and tend to be rigid and brittle; they also tend to have high melting and boiling points, which\nsuggests that ionic bonds are very strong. Ionic solids are also poor conductors of electricity for the same\nreason—the strength of ionic bonds prevents ions from moving freely in the solid state. Most ionic solids,\nhowever, dissolve readily in water. Once dissolved or melted, ionic compounds are excellent conductors of\nelectricity and heat because the ions can move about freely.\nNeutral atoms and their associated ions have very different physical and chemical properties. Sodium atoms\nform sodium metal, a soft, silvery-white metal that burns vigorously in air and reacts explosively with water.\nChlorine atoms form chlorine gas, Cl2, a yellow-green gas that is extremely corrosive to most metals and very\npoisonous to animals and plants. The vigorous reaction between the elements sodium and chlorine forms the\nwhite, crystalline compound sodium chloride, common table salt, which contains sodium cations and chloride\nanions (Figure 7.2). The compound composed of these ions exhibits properties entirely different from the\nproperties of the elements sodium and chlorine. Chlorine is poisonous, but sodium chloride is essential to life;\nsodium atoms react vigorously with water, but sodium chloride simply dissolves in water.\nFIGURE 7.2\n(a) Sodium is a soft metal that must be stored in mineral oil to prevent reaction with air or water. (b)\nChlorine is a pale yellow-green gas. (c) When combined, they form white crystals of sodium chloride (table salt).\n(credit a: modification of work by “Jurii”/Wikimedia Commons)\nThe Formation of Ionic Compounds\nBinary ionic compounds are composed of just two elements: a metal (which forms the cations) and a nonmetal\n(which forms the anions). For example, NaCl is a binary ionic compound. We can think about the formation of\nsuch compounds in terms of the periodic properties of the elements. Many metallic elements have relatively\nlow ionization potentials and lose electrons easily. These elements lie to the left in a period or near the bottom\nof a group on the periodic table. Nonmetal atoms have relatively high electron affinities and thus readily gain\nelectrons lost by metal atoms, thereby filling their valence shells. Nonmetallic elements are found in the\nupper-right corner of the periodic table.\nAs all substances must be electrically neutral, the total number of positive charges on the cations of an ionic\ncompound must equal the total number of negative charges on its anions. The formula of an ionic compound\nrepresents the simplest ratio of the numbers of ions necessary to give identical numbers of positive and\nnegative charges. For example, the formula for aluminum oxide, Al2O3, indicates that this ionic compound\ncontains two aluminum cations, Al3+, for every three oxide anions, O2−[thus, (2\n+3) + (3\n–2) = 0].\nIt is important to note, however, that the formula for an ionic compound does not represent the physical\narrangement of its ions. It is incorrect to refer to a sodium chloride (NaCl) “molecule” because there is not a\n314\n7 • Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

          "text": "single ionic bond, per se, between any specific pair of sodium and chloride ions. The attractive forces between\nions are isotropic—the same in all directions—meaning that any particular ion is equally attracted to all of the\nnearby ions of opposite charge. This results in the ions arranging themselves into a tightly bound, three-\ndimensional lattice structure. Sodium chloride, for example, consists of a regular arrangement of equal\nnumbers of Na+ cations and Cl– anions (Figure 7.3).\nFIGURE 7.3\nThe atoms in sodium chloride (common table salt) are arranged to (a) maximize opposite charges\ninteracting. The smaller spheres represent sodium ions, the larger ones represent chloride ions. In the expanded\nview (b), the geometry can be seen more clearly. Note that each ion is “bonded” to all of the surrounding ions—six in\nthis case.\nThe strong electrostatic attraction between Na+ and Cl– ions holds them tightly together in solid NaCl. It\nrequires 769 kJ of energy to dissociate one mole of solid NaCl into separate gaseous Na+ and Cl– ions:\nElectronic Structures of Cations\nWhen forming a cation, an atom of a main group element tends to lose all of its valence electrons, thus\nassuming the electronic structure of the noble gas that precedes it in the periodic table. For groups 1 (the alkali\nmetals) and 2 (the alkaline earth metals), the group numbers are equal to the numbers of valence shell\nelectrons and, consequently, to the charges of the cations formed from atoms of these elements when all\nvalence shell electrons are removed. For example, calcium is a group 2 element whose neutral atoms have 20\nelectrons and a ground state electron configuration of 1s22s22p63s23p64s2. When a Ca atom loses both of its\nvalence electrons, the result is a cation with 18 electrons, a 2+ charge, and an electron configuration of\n1s22s22p63s23p6. The Ca2+ ion is therefore isoelectronic with the noble gas Ar.\nFor groups 13–17, the group numbers exceed the number of valence electrons by 10 (accounting for the\npossibility of full d subshells in atoms of elements in the fourth and greater periods). Thus, the charge of a\ncation formed by the loss of all valence electrons is equal to the group number minus 10. For example,\naluminum (in group 13) forms 3+ ions (Al3+).\nExceptions to the expected behavior involve elements toward the bottom of the groups. In addition to the\nexpected ions Tl3+, Sn4+, Pb4+, and Bi5+, a partial loss of these atoms’ valence shell electrons can also lead to\nthe formation of Tl+, Sn2+, Pb2+, and Bi3+ ions. The formation of these 1+, 2+, and 3+ cations is ascribed to the\ninert pair effect, which reflects the relatively low energy of the valence s-electron pair for atoms of the heavy\nelements of groups 13, 14, and 15. Mercury (group 12) also exhibits an unexpected behavior: it forms a\ndiatomic ion,\n(an ion formed from two mercury atoms, with an Hg-Hg bond), in addition to the expected\nmonatomic ion Hg2+ (formed from only one mercury atom).\nTransition and inner transition metal elements behave differently than main group elements. Most transition\nmetal cations have 2+ or 3+ charges that result from the loss of their outermost s electron(s) first, sometimes\nfollowed by the loss of one or two d electrons from the next-to-outermost shell. For example, iron\n(1s22s22p63s23p63d64s2) forms the ion Fe2+ (1s22s22p63s23p63d6) by the loss of the 4s electrons and the ion\nFe3+ (1s22s22p63s23p63d5) by the loss of the 4s electrons and one of the 3d electrons.

When the inner\ntransition metals form ions, they usually have a 3+ charge, resulting from the loss of their outermost s\nelectrons and a d or f electron.\nEXAMPLE 7.1\nDetermining the Electronic Structures of Cations\nThere are at least 14 elements categorized as “essential trace elements” for the human body. They are called\n“essential” because they are required for healthy bodily functions, “trace” because they are required only in\nsmall amounts, and “elements” in spite of the fact that they are really ions. Two of these essential trace\nelements, chromium and zinc, are required as Cr3+ and Zn2+. Write the electron configurations of these\ncations.\nSolution\nFirst, write the electron configuration for the neutral atoms:\nZn: [Ar]3d104s2\nCr: [Ar]3d54s1\nNext, remove electrons from the highest energy orbital. For the transition metals, electrons are removed from\nthe s orbital first and then from the d orbital. For the p-block elements, electrons are removed from the p\norbitals and then from the s orbital. Zinc is a member of group 12, so it should have a charge of 2+, and thus\nloses only the two electrons in its s orbital. Chromium is a transition element and should lose its s electrons\nand then its d electrons when forming a cation. Thus, we find the following electron configurations of the ions:\nZn2+: [Ar]3d10\nCr3+: [Ar]3d3\nCheck Your Learning\nPotassium and magnesium are required in our diet. Write the electron configurations of the ions expected\nfrom these elements.\nAnswer:\nK+: [Ar], Mg2+: [Ne]\nElectronic Structures of Anions\nMost monatomic anions form when a neutral nonmetal atom gains enough electrons to completely fill its outer\ns and p orbitals, thereby reaching the electron configuration of the next noble gas. Thus, it is simple to\ndetermine the charge on such a negative ion: The charge is equal to the number of electrons that must be\ngained to fill the s and p orbitals of the parent atom. Oxygen, for example, has the electron configuration\n1s22s22p4, whereas the oxygen anion has the electron configuration of the noble gas neon (Ne), 1s22s22p6. The\ntwo additional electrons required to fill the valence orbitals give the oxide ion the charge of 2– (O2–).\nEXAMPLE 7.2\nDetermining the Electronic Structure of Anions\nSelenium and iodine are two essential trace elements that form anions.

A different type of bonding results from the\nmutual attraction of atoms for a “shared” pair of electrons. Such bonds are called covalent bonds. Covalent\nbonds are formed between two atoms when both have similar tendencies to attract electrons to themselves\n(i.e., when both atoms have identical or fairly similar ionization energies and electron affinities). For example,\ntwo hydrogen atoms bond covalently to form an H2 molecule; each hydrogen atom in the H2 molecule has two\nelectrons stabilizing it, giving each atom the same number of valence electrons as the noble gas He.\nCompounds that contain covalent bonds exhibit different physical properties than ionic compounds. Because\nthe attraction between molecules, which are electrically neutral, is weaker than that between electrically\ncharged ions, covalent compounds generally have much lower melting and boiling points than ionic\ncompounds. In fact, many covalent compounds are liquids or gases at room temperature, and, in their solid\nstates, they are typically much softer than ionic solids. Furthermore, whereas ionic compounds are good\nconductors of electricity when dissolved in water, most covalent compounds are insoluble in water; since they\nare electrically neutral, they are poor conductors of electricity in any state.\nFormation of Covalent Bonds\nNonmetal atoms frequently form covalent bonds with other nonmetal atoms. For example, the hydrogen\nmolecule, H2, contains a covalent bond between its two hydrogen atoms. Figure 7.4 illustrates why this bond is\nformed. Starting on the far right, we have two separate hydrogen atoms with a particular potential energy,\nindicated by the red line. Along the x-axis is the distance between the two atoms. As the two atoms approach\neach other (moving left along the x-axis), their valence orbitals (1s) begin to overlap. The single electrons on\neach hydrogen atom then interact with both atomic nuclei, occupying the space around both atoms. The strong\nattraction of each shared electron to both nuclei stabilizes the system, and the potential energy decreases as\nthe bond distance decreases. If the atoms continue to approach each other, the positive charges in the two\nnuclei begin to repel each other, and the potential energy increases. The bond length is determined by the\ndistance at which the lowest potential energy is achieved.\n7.2 • Covalent Bonding\n317",

In the case of H2, the covalent bond\nis very strong; a large amount of energy, 436 kJ, must be added to break the bonds in one mole of hydrogen\nmolecules and cause the atoms to separate:\nConversely, the same amount of energy is released when one mole of H2 molecules forms from two moles of H\natoms:\nPure vs. Polar Covalent Bonds\nIf the atoms that form a covalent bond are identical, as in H2, Cl2, and other diatomic molecules, then the\nelectrons in the bond must be shared equally.

          "text": "pure covalent bonds have an equal probability of being near each nucleus.\nIn the case of Cl2, each atom starts off with seven valence electrons, and each Cl shares one electron with the\nother, forming one covalent bond:\nThe total number of electrons around each individual atom consists of six nonbonding electrons and two\nshared (i.e., bonding) electrons for eight total electrons, matching the number of valence electrons in the noble\ngas argon. Since the bonding atoms are identical, Cl2 also features a pure covalent bond.\nWhen the atoms linked by a covalent bond are different, the bonding electrons are shared, but no longer\nequally. Instead, the bonding electrons are more attracted to one atom than the other, giving rise to a shift of\nelectron density toward that atom. This unequal distribution of electrons is known as a polar covalent bond,\ncharacterized by a partial positive charge on one atom and a partial negative charge on the other. The atom\nthat attracts the electrons more strongly acquires the partial negative charge and vice versa. For example, the\nelectrons in the H–Cl bond of a hydrogen chloride molecule spend more time near the chlorine atom than near\nthe hydrogen atom. Thus, in an HCl molecule, the chlorine atom carries a partial negative charge and the\nhydrogen atom has a partial positive charge. Figure 7.5 shows the distribution of electrons in the H–Cl bond.\nNote that the shaded area around Cl is much larger than it is around H. Compare this to Figure 7.4, which\nshows the even distribution of electrons in the H2 nonpolar bond.\nWe sometimes designate the positive and negative atoms in a polar covalent bond using a lowercase Greek\nletter “delta,” δ, with a plus sign or minus sign to indicate whether the atom has a partial positive charge (δ+) or\na partial negative charge (δ–). This symbolism is shown for the H–Cl molecule in Figure 7.5.\nFIGURE 7.5\n(a) The distribution of electron density in the HCl molecule is uneven. The electron density is greater\naround the chlorine nucleus. The small, black dots indicate the location of the hydrogen and chlorine nuclei in the\nmolecule. (b) Symbols δ+ and δ– indicate the polarity of the H–Cl bond.\nElectronegativity\nWhether a bond is nonpolar or polar covalent is determined by a property of the bonding atoms called\nelectronegativity. Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract electrons (or electron\ndensity) towards itself. It determines how the shared electrons are distributed between the two atoms in a\nbond. The more strongly an atom attracts the electrons in its bonds, the larger its electronegativity. Electrons\nin a polar covalent bond are shifted toward the more electronegative atom; thus, the more electronegative\natom is the one with the partial negative charge. The greater the difference in electronegativity, the more\npolarized the electron distribution and the larger the partial charges of the atoms.\nFigure 7.6 shows the electronegativity values of the elements as proposed by one of the most famous chemists\nof the twentieth century: Linus Pauling (Figure 7.7). In general, electronegativity increases from left to right\nacross a period in the periodic table and decreases down a group. Thus, the nonmetals, which lie in the upper\nright, tend to have the highest electronegativities, with fluorine the most electronegative element of all (EN =\n4.0). Metals tend to be less electronegative elements, and the group 1 metals have the lowest\nelectronegativities. Note that noble gases are excluded from this figure because these atoms usually do not\nshare electrons with others atoms since they have a full valence shell. (While noble gas compounds such as\nXeO2 do exist, they can only be formed under extreme conditions, and thus they do not fit neatly into the\ngeneral model of electronegativity.)\n7.2 • Covalent Bonding\n319",

When the difference is very small or zero,\nthe bond is covalent and nonpolar. When it is large, the bond is polar covalent or ionic. The absolute values of\nthe electronegativity differences between the atoms in the bonds H–H, H–Cl, and Na–Cl are 0 (nonpolar), 0.9\n(polar covalent), and 2.1 (ionic), respectively. The degree to which electrons are shared between atoms varies\nfrom completely equal (pure covalent bonding) to not at all (ionic bonding). Figure 7.8 shows the relationship\nbetween electronegativity difference and bond type.\nFIGURE 7.8\nAs the electronegativity difference increases between two atoms, the bond becomes more ionic.\nA rough approximation of the electronegativity differences associated with covalent, polar covalent, and ionic\nbonds is shown in Figure 7.8. This table is just a general guide, however, with many exceptions. For example,\nthe H and F atoms in HF have an electronegativity difference of 1.9, and the N and H atoms in NH3 a difference\nof 0.9, yet both of these compounds form bonds that are considered polar covalent. Likewise, the Na and Cl\natoms in NaCl have an electronegativity difference of 2.1, and the Mn and I atoms in MnI2 have a difference of\n1.0, yet both of these substances form ionic compounds.\nThe best guide to the covalent or ionic character of a bond is to consider the types of atoms involved and their\nrelative positions in the periodic table.

The total number of electrons does not change.\nLewis Structures\nWe also use Lewis symbols to indicate the formation of covalent bonds, which are shown in Lewis structures,\ndrawings that describe the bonding in molecules and polyatomic ions. For example, when two chlorine atoms\nform a chlorine molecule, they share one pair of electrons:\nThe Lewis structure indicates that each Cl atom has three pairs of electrons that are not used in bonding\n(called lone pairs) and one shared pair of electrons (written between the atoms). A dash (or line) is sometimes\nused to indicate a shared pair of electrons:\nA single shared pair of electrons is called a single bond. Each Cl atom interacts with eight valence electrons:\nthe six in the lone pairs and the two in the single bond.\nThe Octet Rule\nThe other halogen molecules (F2, Br2, I2, and At2) form bonds like those in the chlorine molecule: one single\nbond between atoms and three lone pairs of electrons per atom. This allows each halogen atom to have a noble\ngas electron configuration. The tendency of main group atoms to form enough bonds to obtain eight valence\nelectrons is known as the octet rule.\nThe number of bonds that an atom can form can often be predicted from the number of electrons needed to\nreach an octet (eight valence electrons); this is especially true of the nonmetals of the second period of the\nperiodic table (C, N, O, and F). For example, each atom of a group 14 element has four electrons in its\noutermost shell and therefore requires four more electrons to reach an octet. These four electrons can be\ngained by forming four covalent bonds, as illustrated here for carbon in CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride) and silicon\nin SiH4 (silane). Because hydrogen only needs two electrons to fill its valence shell, it is an exception to the\noctet rule. The transition elements and inner transition elements also do not follow the octet rule:\n324\n7 • Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Soot has been used as a\npigment (often called carbon black) for thousands of years. Charcoal, high in carbon content, has likewise been\ncritical to human development. Carbon is the key additive to iron in the steelmaking process, and diamonds\nhave a unique place in both culture and industry. With all this usage came significant study, particularly with\nthe emergence of organic chemistry. And even with all the known forms and functions of the element,\nscientists began to uncover the potential for even more varied and extensive carbon structures.\nAs early as the 1960s, chemists began to observe complex carbon structures, but they had little evidence to\nsupport their concepts, or their work did not make it into the mainstream. Eiji Osawa predicted a spherical\nform based on observations of a similar structure, but his work was not widely known outside Japan. In a\nsimilar manner, the most comprehensive advance was likely computational chemist Elena Galpern's, who in\n1973 predicted a highly stable, 60-carbon molecule; her work was also isolated to her native Russia. Still later,\nHarold Kroto, working with Canadian radio astronomers, sought to uncover the nature of long carbon chains\nthat had been discovered in interstellar space.\nKroto sought to use a machine developed by Richard Smalley's team at Rice University to learn more about\nthese structures. Together with Robert Curl, who had introduced them, and three graduate students—James\nHeath, Sean O’Brien, and Yuan Liu—they performed an intensive series of experiments that led to a major\ndiscovery.\nIn 1996, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Richard Smalley (Figure 7.11), Robert Curl, and Harold\nKroto for their work in discovering a new form of carbon, the C60 buckminsterfullerene molecule (Figure 7.1).\nAn entire class of compounds, including spheres and tubes of various shapes, were discovered based on C60.\nThis type of molecule, called a fullerene, shows promise in a variety of applications. Because of their size and\nshape, fullerenes can encapsulate other molecules, so they have shown potential in various applications from\nhydrogen storage to targeted drug delivery systems. They also possess unique electronic and optical\nproperties that have been put to good use in solar powered devices and chemical sensors.\nFIGURE 7.11\nRichard Smalley (1943–2005), a professor of physics, chemistry, and astronomy at Rice University,\nwas one of the leading advocates for fullerene chemistry.

Nitric oxide, NO, is an example of an\nodd-electron molecule; it is produced in internal combustion engines when oxygen and nitrogen react at high\ntemperatures.\nTo draw the Lewis structure for an odd-electron molecule like NO, we follow the same five steps we would for\nother molecules, but with a few minor changes:\n1.\nDetermine the total number of valence (outer shell) electrons. The sum of the valence electrons is 5 (from\nN) + 6 (from O) = 11.

We know that an odd-electron molecule cannot have an octet for every atom, but we want to get\neach atom as close to an octet as possible. In this case, nitrogen has only five electrons around it. To move\ncloser to an octet for nitrogen, we take one of the lone pairs from oxygen and use it to form a NO double\nbond. (We cannot take another lone pair of electrons on oxygen and form a triple bond because nitrogen\nwould then have nine electrons:)\nElectron-deficient Molecules\nWe will also encounter a few molecules that contain central atoms that do not have a filled valence shell.\nGenerally, these are molecules with central atoms from groups 2 and 13, outer atoms that are hydrogen, or\nother atoms that do not form multiple bonds. For example, in the Lewis structures of beryllium dihydride,\nBeH2, and boron trifluoride, BF3, the beryllium and boron atoms each have only four and six electrons,\nrespectively. It is possible to draw a structure with a double bond between a boron atom and a fluorine atom in\nBF3, satisfying the octet rule, but experimental evidence indicates the bond lengths are closer to that expected\nfor B–F single bonds. This suggests the best Lewis structure has three B–F single bonds and an electron\ndeficient boron. The reactivity of the compound is also consistent with an electron deficient boron. However,\nthe B–F bonds are slightly shorter than what is actually expected for B–F single bonds, indicating that some\ndouble bond character is found in the actual molecule.\nAn atom like the boron atom in BF3, which does not have eight electrons, is very reactive. It readily combines\nwith a molecule containing an atom with a lone pair of electrons.

In many cases, following the\nsteps for writing Lewis structures may lead to more than one possible molecular structure—different multiple\nbond and lone-pair electron placements or different arrangements of atoms, for instance. A few guidelines\ninvolving formal charge can be helpful in deciding which of the possible structures is most likely for a\nparticular molecule or ion:\n1.\nA molecular structure in which all formal charges are zero is preferable to one in which some formal\ncharges are not zero.\n2.\nIf the Lewis structure must have nonzero formal charges, the arrangement with the smallest nonzero\nformal charges is preferable.\n3.\nLewis structures are preferable when adjacent formal charges are zero or of the opposite sign.\n4.\nWhen we must choose among several Lewis structures with similar distributions of formal charges, the\nstructure with the negative formal charges on the more electronegative atoms is preferable.\nTo see how these guidelines apply, let us consider some possible structures for carbon dioxide, CO2. We know\nfrom our previous discussion that the less electronegative atom typically occupies the central position, but\nformal charges allow us to understand why this occurs. We can draw three possibilities for the structure:\ncarbon in the center and double bonds, carbon in the center with a single and triple bond, and oxygen in the\ncenter with double bonds:\nComparing the three formal charges, we can definitively identify the structure on the left as preferable because\nit has only formal charges of zero (Guideline 1).\nAs another example, the thiocyanate ion, an ion formed from a carbon atom, a nitrogen atom, and a sulfur\natom, could have three different molecular structures: NCS–, CNS–, or CSN–. The formal charges present in\neach of these molecular structures can help us pick the most likely arrangement of atoms.

The actual electronic structure of the molecule (the average of the resonance forms) is\ncalled a resonance hybrid of the individual resonance forms. A double-headed arrow between Lewis\nstructures indicates that they are resonance forms.\nWe should remember that a molecule described as a resonance hybrid never possesses an electronic structure\ndescribed by either resonance form. It does not fluctuate between resonance forms; rather, the actual\nelectronic structure is always the average of that shown by all resonance forms. George Wheland, one of the\npioneers of resonance theory, used a historical analogy to describe the relationship between resonance forms\nand resonance hybrids. A medieval traveler, having never before seen a rhinoceros, described it as a hybrid of\na dragon and a unicorn because it had many properties in common with both.

In this section, you will learn about the bond strength of\ncovalent bonds, and then compare that to the strength of ionic bonds, which is related to the lattice energy of a\ncompound.\nBond Strength: Covalent Bonds\nStable molecules exist because covalent bonds hold the atoms together. We measure the strength of a covalent\nbond by the energy required to break it, that is, the energy necessary to separate the bonded atoms. Separating\nany pair of bonded atoms requires energy (see Figure 7.4). The stronger a bond, the greater the energy\nrequired to break it.\nThe energy required to break a specific covalent bond in one mole of gaseous molecules is called the bond\nenergy or the bond dissociation energy. The bond energy for a diatomic molecule, DX–Y, is defined as the\nstandard enthalpy change for the endothermic reaction:\nFor example, the bond energy of the pure covalent H–H bond, DH–H, is 436 kJ per mole of H–H bonds broken:\nMolecules with three or more atoms have two or more bonds. The sum of all bond energies in such a molecule\nis equal to the standard enthalpy change for the endothermic reaction that breaks all the bonds in the\nmolecule. For example, the sum of the four C–H bond energies in CH4, 1660 kJ, is equal to the standard\nenthalpy change of the reaction:\n336\n7 • Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Although the four C–H bonds are equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each\nrequire the same energy to break; once the first bond is broken (which requires 439 kJ/mol), the remaining\nbonds are easier to break. The 415 kJ/mol value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one\nbond.\nThe strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases.\nGenerally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are\nstronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and\nshorter than single bonds between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds\nappear in Table 7.2, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\nTable 7.3.

The energy\nrequired to break these bonds is the sum of the bond energy of the H–H bond (436 kJ/mol) and the Cl–Cl bond\n(243 kJ/mol).

The\nlattice energy of a compound is a measure of the strength of this attraction. The lattice energy (ΔHlattice) of an\nionic compound is defined as the energy required to separate one mole of the solid into its component gaseous\nions. For the ionic solid MX, the lattice energy is the enthalpy change of the process:\nNote that we are using the convention where the ionic solid is separated into ions, so our lattice energies will\nbe endothermic (positive values). Some texts use the equivalent but opposite convention, defining lattice\nenergy as the energy released when separate ions combine to form a lattice and giving negative (exothermic)\nvalues. Thus, if you are looking up lattice energies in another reference, be certain to check which definition is\nbeing used. In both cases, a larger magnitude for lattice energy indicates a more stable ionic compound. For\nsodium chloride, ΔHlattice = 769 kJ. Thus, it requires 769 kJ to separate one mole of solid NaCl into gaseous Na+\nand Cl– ions. When one mole each of gaseous Na+ and Cl– ions form solid NaCl, 769 kJ of heat is released.\nThe lattice energy ΔHlattice of an ionic crystal can be expressed by the following equation (derived from\nCoulomb’s law, governing the forces between electric charges):\nin which C is a constant that depends on the type of crystal structure; Z+ and Z– are the charges on the ions;\nand Ro is the interionic distance (the sum of the radii of the positive and negative ions).

A bond distance (or bond length) is\nthe distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms along the straight line joining the nuclei.

The Lewis\nstructure of BeF2 (Figure 7.15) shows only two electron pairs around the central beryllium atom.

VSEPR theory predicts these distortions by establishing\nan order of repulsions and an order of the amount of space occupied by different kinds of electron pairs. The\norder of electron-pair repulsions from greatest to least repulsion is:\nThis order of repulsions determines the amount of space occupied by different regions of electrons.

          "text": "Answer:\nAnswers will vary. For example, an atom with four single bonds, a double bond, and a lone pair has an\noctahedral electron-group geometry and a square pyramidal molecular structure. XeOF4 is a molecule that\nadopts this structure.\nMolecular Polarity and Dipole Moment\nAs discussed previously, polar covalent bonds connect two atoms with differing electronegativities, leaving one\natom with a partial positive charge (δ+) and the other atom with a partial negative charge (δ–), as the electrons\nare pulled toward the more electronegative atom. This separation of charge gives rise to a bond dipole\nmoment. The magnitude of a bond dipole moment is represented by the Greek letter mu (µ) and is given by the\nformula shown here, where Q is the magnitude of the partial charges (determined by the electronegativity\ndifference) and r is the distance between the charges:\nThis bond moment can be represented as a vector, a quantity having both direction and magnitude (Figure\n7.26). Dipole vectors are shown as arrows pointing along the bond from the less electronegative atom toward\nthe more electronegative atom. A small plus sign is drawn on the less electronegative end to indicate the\npartially positive end of the bond. The length of the arrow is proportional to the magnitude of the\nelectronegativity difference between the two atoms.\nFIGURE 7.26\n(a) There is a small difference in electronegativity between C and H, represented as a short vector.\n(b) The electronegativity difference between B and F is much larger, so the vector representing the bond moment is\nmuch longer.\nA whole molecule may also have a separation of charge, depending on its molecular structure and the polarity\nof each of its bonds. If such a charge separation exists, the molecule is said to be a polar molecule (or dipole);\notherwise the molecule is said to be nonpolar. The dipole moment measures the extent of net charge\nseparation in the molecule as a whole. We determine the dipole moment by adding the bond moments in\nthree-dimensional space, taking into account the molecular structure.\nFor diatomic molecules, there is only one bond, so its bond dipole moment determines the molecular polarity.\nHomonuclear diatomic molecules such as Br2 and N2 have no difference in electronegativity, so their dipole\nmoment is zero. For heteronuclear molecules such as CO, there is a small dipole moment. For HF, there is a\nlarger dipole moment because there is a larger difference in electronegativity.\nWhen a molecule contains more than one bond, the geometry must be taken into account. If the bonds in a\nmolecule are arranged such that their bond moments cancel (vector sum equals zero), then the molecule is\nnonpolar. This is the situation in CO2 (Figure 7.27). Each of the bonds is polar, but the molecule as a whole is\nnonpolar. From the Lewis structure, and using VSEPR theory, we determine that the CO2 molecule is linear\nwith polar C=O bonds on opposite sides of the carbon atom. The bond moments cancel because they are\npointed in opposite directions. In the case of the water molecule (Figure 7.27), the Lewis structure again shows\nthat there are two bonds to a central atom, and the electronegativity difference again shows that each of these\nbonds has a nonzero bond moment. In this case, however, the molecular structure is bent because of the lone\npairs on O, and the two bond moments do not cancel. Therefore, water does have a net dipole moment and is a\npolar molecule (dipole).\n354\n7 • Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

(a) Each CO bond has a bond dipole moment, but they point in opposite directions so that the net\nCO2 molecule is nonpolar. (b) In contrast, water is polar because the OH bond moments do not cancel out.\nThe OCS molecule has a structure similar to CO2, but a sulfur atom has replaced one of the oxygen atoms. To\ndetermine if this molecule is polar, we draw the molecular structure. VSEPR theory predicts a linear molecule:\nThe C-O bond is considerably polar. Although C and S have very similar electronegativity values, S is slightly\nmore electronegative than C, and so the C-S bond is just slightly polar. Because oxygen is more electronegative\nthan sulfur, the oxygen end of the molecule is the negative end.\nChloromethane, CH3Cl, is a tetrahedral molecule with three slightly polar C-H bonds and a more polar C-Cl\nbond. The relative electronegativities of the bonded atoms is H < C < Cl, and so the bond moments all point\ntoward the Cl end of the molecule and sum to yield a considerable dipole moment (the molecules are relatively\npolar).\nFor molecules of high symmetry such as BF3 (trigonal planar), CH4 (tetrahedral), PF5 (trigonal bipyramidal),\nand SF6 (octahedral), all the bonds are of identical polarity (same bond moment) and they are oriented in\ngeometries that yield nonpolar molecules (dipole moment is zero).

The\ncharges of cations formed by the representative\nmetals may be determined readily because, with few\nexceptions, the electronic structures of these ions\nhave either a noble gas configuration or a completely\nfilled electron shell. The charges of anions formed\nby the nonmetals may also be readily determined\nbecause these ions form when nonmetal atoms gain\nenough electrons to fill their valence shells.\n7.2 Covalent Bonding\nCovalent bonds form when electrons are shared\nbetween atoms and are attracted by the nuclei of\nboth atoms. In pure covalent bonds, the electrons\nare shared equally. In polar covalent bonds, the\nelectrons are shared unequally, as one atom exerts a\nstronger force of attraction on the electrons than the\nother. The ability of an atom to attract a pair of\nelectrons in a chemical bond is called its\nelectronegativity. The difference in electronegativity\nbetween two atoms determines how polar a bond\nwill be. In a diatomic molecule with two identical\natoms, there is no difference in electronegativity, so\nthe bond is nonpolar or pure covalent. When the\nelectronegativity difference is very large, as is the\ncase between metals and nonmetals, the bonding is\ncharacterized as ionic.\n7.3 Lewis Symbols and Structures\nValence electronic structures can be visualized by\ndrawing Lewis symbols (for atoms and monatomic\nions) and Lewis structures (for molecules and\npolyatomic ions). Lone pairs, unpaired electrons,\nand single, double, or triple bonds are used to\nindicate where the valence electrons are located\naround each atom in a Lewis structure. Most\nstructures—especially those containing second row\nelements—obey the octet rule, in which every atom\n(except H) is surrounded by eight electrons.\nExceptions to the octet rule occur for odd-electron\nmolecules (free radicals), electron-deficient\nmolecules, and hypervalent molecules.\n7.4 Formal Charges and Resonance\nIn a Lewis structure, formal charges can be assigned\nto each atom by treating each bond as if one-half of\nthe electrons are assigned to each atom. These\nhypothetical formal charges are a guide to\ndetermining the most appropriate Lewis structure. A\nstructure in which the formal charges are as close to\nzero as possible is preferred. Resonance occurs in\ncases where two or more Lewis structures with\nidentical arrangements of atoms but different\ndistributions of electrons can be written. The actual\ndistribution of electrons (the resonance hybrid) is an\naverage of the distribution indicated by the\nindividual Lewis structures (the resonance forms).\n7 • Key Equations\n359",

Multiple bonds are stronger than\nsingle bonds between the same atoms. The enthalpy\nof a reaction can be estimated based on the energy\ninput required to break bonds and the energy\nreleased when new bonds are formed. For ionic\nbonds, the lattice energy is the energy required to\nseparate one mole of a compound into its gas phase\nions.

A dipole moment measures a\nseparation of charge. For one bond, the bond dipole\nmoment is determined by the difference in\nelectronegativity between the two atoms. For a\nmolecule, the overall dipole moment is determined\nby both the individual bond moments and how these\ndipoles are arranged in the molecular structure.\nPolar molecules (those with an appreciable dipole\nmoment) interact with electric fields, whereas\nnonpolar molecules do not.\nExercises\n7.1 Ionic Bonding\n1.

We need to understand the additional concepts of valence bond theory,\norbital hybridization, and molecular orbital theory to understand these observations.\n8.1 Valence Bond Theory\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the formation of covalent bonds in terms of atomic orbital overlap\n•\nDefine and give examples of σ and π bonds\nAs we know, a scientific theory is a strongly supported explanation for observed natural laws or large bodies of\nexperimental data. For a theory to be accepted, it must explain experimental data and be able to predict\nbehavior. For example, VSEPR theory has gained widespread acceptance because it predicts three-\ndimensional molecular shapes that are consistent with experimental data collected for thousands of different\nmolecules. However, VSEPR theory does not provide an explanation of chemical bonding.\nThere are successful theories that describe the electronic structure of atoms. We can use quantum mechanics\nto predict the specific regions around an atom where electrons are likely to be located: A spherical shape for an\ns orbital, a dumbbell shape for a p orbital, and so forth. However, these predictions only describe the orbitals\naround free atoms. When atoms bond to form molecules, atomic orbitals are not sufficient to describe the\nregions where electrons will be located in the molecule. A more complete understanding of electron\ndistributions requires a model that can account for the electronic structure of molecules. One popular theory\nholds that a covalent bond forms when a pair of electrons is shared by two atoms and is simultaneously\nattracted by the nuclei of both atoms. In the following sections, we will discuss how such bonds are described\nby valence bond theory and hybridization.\nValence bond theory describes a covalent bond as the overlap of half-filled atomic orbitals (each containing a\nsingle electron) that yield a pair of electrons shared between the two bonded atoms. We say that orbitals on two\ndifferent atoms overlap when a portion of one orbital and a portion of a second orbital occupy the same region\nof space. According to valence bond theory, a covalent bond results when two conditions are met: (1) an orbital\non one atom overlaps an orbital on a second atom and (2) the single electrons in each orbital combine to form\nan electron pair. The mutual attraction between this negatively charged electron pair and the two atoms’\npositively charged nuclei serves to physically link the two atoms through a force we define as a covalent bond.\nThe strength of a covalent bond depends on the extent of overlap of the orbitals involved. Orbitals that overlap\nextensively form bonds that are stronger than those that have less overlap.\nThe energy of the system depends on how much the orbitals overlap. Figure 8.2 illustrates how the sum of the\nenergies of two hydrogen atoms (the colored curve) changes as they approach each other. When the atoms are\nfar apart there is no overlap, and by convention we set the sum of the energies at zero. As the atoms move\ntogether, their orbitals begin to overlap. Each electron begins to feel the attraction of the nucleus in the other\natom. In addition, the electrons begin to repel each other, as do the nuclei. While the atoms are still widely\nseparated, the attractions are slightly stronger than the repulsions, and the energy of the system decreases. (A\nbond begins to form.) As the atoms move closer together, the overlap increases, so the attraction of the nuclei\nfor the electrons continues to increase (as do the repulsions among electrons and between the nuclei). At some\nspecific distance between the atoms, which varies depending on the atoms involved, the energy reaches its\nlowest (most stable) value. This optimum distance between the two bonded nuclei is the bond distance\nbetween the two atoms. The bond is stable because at this point, the attractive and repulsive forces combine to\ncreate the lowest possible energy configuration. If the distance between the nuclei were to decrease further,\nthe repulsions between nuclei and the repulsions as electrons are confined in closer proximity to each other\nwould become stronger than the attractive forces. The energy of the system would then rise (making the\nsystem destabilized), as shown at the far left of Figure 8.2.\n376\n8 • Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

The lowest (most stable) energy occurs at a distance of 74 pm, which is the\nbond length observed for the H2 molecule.\nThe bond energy is the difference between the energy minimum (which occurs at the bond distance) and the\nenergy of the two separated atoms. This is the quantity of energy released when the bond is formed.\nConversely, the same amount of energy is required to break the bond. For the H2 molecule shown in Figure 8.2,\nat the bond distance of 74 pm the system is 7.24\n10−19 J lower in energy than the two separated hydrogen\natoms. This may seem like a small number. However, we know from our earlier description of\nthermochemistry that bond energies are often discussed on a per-mole basis. For example, it requires 7.24\n10−19 J to break one H–H bond, but it takes 4.36\n105 J to break 1 mole of H–H bonds. A comparison of some\nbond lengths and energies is shown in Table 8.1.

Greater overlap is possible when orbitals are oriented\nsuch that they overlap on a direct line between the two nuclei. Figure 8.3 illustrates this for two p orbitals from\ndifferent atoms; the overlap is greater when the orbitals overlap end to end rather than at an angle.\nFIGURE 8.3\n(a) The overlap of two p orbitals is greatest when the orbitals are directed end to end. (b) Any other\narrangement results in less overlap. The dots indicate the locations of the nuclei.\nThe overlap of two s orbitals (as in H2), the overlap of an s orbital and a p orbital (as in HCl), and the end-to-end\noverlap of two p orbitals (as in Cl2) all produce sigma bonds (σ bonds), as illustrated in Figure 8.4. A σ bond is\na covalent bond in which the electron density is concentrated in the region along the internuclear axis; that is,\na line between the nuclei would pass through the center of the overlap region. Single bonds in Lewis structures\nare described as σ bonds in valence bond theory.\nFIGURE 8.4\nSigma (σ) bonds form from the overlap of the following: (a) two s orbitals, (b) an s orbital and a p\norbital, and (c) two p orbitals. The dots indicate the locations of the nuclei.\nA pi bond (π bond) is a type of covalent bond that results from the side-by-side overlap of two p orbitals, as\nillustrated in Figure 8.5.

          "text": "Thinking in terms of overlapping atomic orbitals is one way for us to explain how chemical bonds form in\ndiatomic molecules. However, to understand how molecules with more than two atoms form stable bonds, we\nrequire a more detailed model. As an example, let us consider the water molecule, in which we have one\noxygen atom bonding to two hydrogen atoms. Oxygen has the electron configuration 1s22s22p4, with two\nunpaired electrons (one in each of the two 2p orbitals). Valence bond theory would predict that the two O–H\nbonds form from the overlap of these two 2p orbitals with the 1s orbitals of the hydrogen atoms. If this were the\ncase, the bond angle would be 90°, as shown in Figure 8.6, because p orbitals are perpendicular to each other.\nExperimental evidence shows that the bond angle is 104.5°, not 90°. The prediction of the valence bond theory\nmodel does not match the real-world observations of a water molecule; a different model is needed.\nFIGURE 8.6\nThe hypothetical overlap of two of the 2p orbitals on an oxygen atom (red) with the 1s orbitals of two\nhydrogen atoms (blue) would produce a bond angle of 90°. This is not consistent with experimental evidence.1\nQuantum-mechanical calculations suggest why the observed bond angles in H2O differ from those predicted\nby the overlap of the 1s orbital of the hydrogen atoms with the 2p orbitals of the oxygen atom. The\nmathematical expression known as the wave function, ψ, contains information about each orbital and the\nwavelike properties of electrons in an isolated atom. When atoms are bound together in a molecule, the wave\nfunctions combine to produce new mathematical descriptions that have different shapes. This process of\ncombining the wave functions for atomic orbitals is called hybridization and is mathematically accomplished\nby the linear combination of atomic orbitals, LCAO, (a technique that we will encounter again later). The new\norbitals that result are called hybrid orbitals. The valence orbitals in an isolated oxygen atom are a 2s orbital\nand three 2p orbitals. The valence orbitals in an oxygen atom in a water molecule differ; they consist of four\nequivalent hybrid orbitals that point approximately toward the corners of a tetrahedron (Figure 8.7).\nConsequently, the overlap of the O and H orbitals should result in a tetrahedral bond angle (109.5°). The\nobserved angle of 104.5° is experimental evidence for which quantum-mechanical calculations give a useful\nexplanation: Valence bond theory must include a hybridization component to give accurate predictions.\nFIGURE 8.7\n(a) A water molecule has four regions of electron density, so VSEPR theory predicts a tetrahedral\narrangement of hybrid orbitals. (b) Two of the hybrid orbitals on oxygen contain lone pairs, and the other two overlap\nwith the 1s orbitals of hydrogen atoms to form the O–H bonds in H2O. This description is more consistent with the\nexperimental structure.\nThe following ideas are important in understanding hybridization:\n1.\nHybrid orbitals do not exist in isolated atoms. They are formed only in covalently bonded atoms.\n2.\nHybrid orbitals have shapes and orientations that are very different from those of the atomic orbitals in\nisolated atoms.\n3.\nA set of hybrid orbitals is generated by combining atomic orbitals. The number of hybrid orbitals in a set is\nequal to the number of atomic orbitals that were combined to produce the set.\n1\nNote that orbitals may sometimes be drawn in an elongated “balloon” shape rather than in a more realistic “plump” shape in\norder to make the geometry easier to visualize.\n380\n8 • Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Unhybridized orbitals overlap to form π bonds.\nIn the following sections, we shall discuss the common types of hybrid orbitals.\nsp Hybridization\nThe beryllium atom in a gaseous BeCl2 molecule is an example of a central atom with no lone pairs of electrons\nin a linear arrangement of three atoms. There are two regions of valence electron density in the BeCl2 molecule\nthat correspond to the two covalent Be–Cl bonds. To accommodate these two electron domains, two of the Be\natom’s four valence orbitals will mix to yield two hybrid orbitals. This hybridization process involves mixing of\nthe valence s orbital with one of the valence p orbitals to yield two equivalent sp hybrid orbitals that are\noriented in a linear geometry (Figure 8.8). In this figure, the set of sp orbitals appears similar in shape to the\noriginal p orbital, but there is an important difference. The number of atomic orbitals combined always equals\nthe number of hybrid orbitals formed. The p orbital is one orbital that can hold up to two electrons. The sp set\nis two equivalent orbitals that point 180° from each other. The two electrons that were originally in the s orbital\nare now distributed to the two sp orbitals, which are half filled. In gaseous BeCl2, these half-filled hybrid\norbitals will overlap with orbitals from the chlorine atoms to form two identical σ bonds.\nFIGURE 8.8\nHybridization of an s orbital (blue) and a p orbital (red) of the same atom produces two sp hybrid\norbitals (yellow). Each hybrid orbital is oriented primarily in just one direction. Note that each sp orbital contains one\nlobe that is significantly larger than the other. The set of two sp orbitals are oriented at 180°, which is consistent\nwith the geometry for two domains.\nWe illustrate the electronic differences in an isolated Be atom and in the bonded Be atom in the orbital energy-\nlevel diagram in Figure 8.9. These diagrams represent each orbital by a horizontal line (indicating its energy)\nand each electron by an arrow. Energy increases toward the top of the diagram. We use one upward arrow to\nindicate one electron in an orbital and two arrows (up and down) to indicate two electrons of opposite spin.\n8.2 • Hybrid Atomic Orbitals\n381",

This results in the formation of four strong, equivalent\ncovalent bonds between the carbon atom and each of the hydrogen atoms to produce the methane molecule,\nCH4.\nThe structure of ethane, C2H6, is similar to that of methane in that each carbon in ethane has four neighboring\natoms arranged at the corners of a tetrahedron—three hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom (Figure 8.17).\nHowever, in ethane an sp3 orbital of one carbon atom overlaps end to end with an sp3 orbital of a second\ncarbon atom to form a σ bond between the two carbon atoms. Each of the remaining sp3 hybrid orbitals\noverlaps with an s orbital of a hydrogen atom to form carbon–hydrogen σ bonds.

Thus we say that the oxygen atom is sp3 hybridized, with two of the hybrid orbitals\noccupied by lone pairs and two by bonding pairs. Since lone pairs occupy more space than bonding pairs,\nstructures that contain lone pairs have bond angles slightly distorted from the ideal. Perfect tetrahedra have\nangles of 109.5°, but the observed angles in ammonia (107.3°) and water (104.5°) are slightly smaller.

With an octahedral arrangement of six hybrid orbitals, we must use six valence shell atomic orbitals\n(the s orbital, the three p orbitals, and two of the d orbitals in its valence shell), which gives six sp3d2 hybrid\norbitals.

Is it also capable of describing molecules containing double and triple bonds? We have already\ndiscussed that multiple bonds consist of σ and π bonds. Next we can consider how we visualize these\ncomponents and how they relate to hybrid orbitals. The Lewis structure of ethene, C2H4, shows us that each\ncarbon atom is surrounded by one other carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms.\nThe three bonding regions form a trigonal planar electron-pair geometry. Thus we expect the σ bonds from\neach carbon atom are formed using a set of sp2 hybrid orbitals that result from hybridization of two of the 2p\norbitals and the 2s orbital (Figure 8.22). These orbitals form the C–H single bonds and the σ bond in the\ndouble bond (Figure 8.23). The π bond in the\ndouble bond results from the overlap of the third\n(remaining) 2p orbital on each carbon atom that is not involved in hybridization. This unhybridized p orbital\n(lobes shown in red and blue in Figure 8.23) is perpendicular to the plane of the sp2 hybrid orbitals. Thus the\nunhybridized 2p orbitals overlap in a side-by-side fashion, above and below the internuclear axis (Figure 8.23)\nand form a π bond.\n390\n8 • Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

The hybrid orbitals overlap to form σ bonds, while the p orbitals on each carbon atom overlap to form a π\nbond.\nFIGURE 8.23\nIn the ethene molecule, C2H4, there are (a) five σ bonds. One C–C σ bond results from overlap of sp2\nhybrid orbitals on the carbon atom with one sp2 hybrid orbital on the other carbon atom. Four C–H bonds result from\nthe overlap between the C atoms' sp2 orbitals with s orbitals on the hydrogen atoms. (b) The π bond is formed by\nthe side-by-side overlap of the two unhybridized p orbitals in the two carbon atoms. The two lobes of the π bond are\nabove and below the plane of the σ system.\nIn an ethene molecule, the four hydrogen atoms and the two carbon atoms are all in the same plane. If the two\nplanes of sp2 hybrid orbitals tilted relative to each other, the p orbitals would not be oriented to overlap\nefficiently to create the π bond. The planar configuration for the ethene molecule occurs because it is the most\nstable bonding arrangement. This is a significant difference between σ and π bonds; rotation around single (σ)\nbonds occurs easily because the end-to-end orbital overlap does not depend on the relative orientation of the\norbitals on each atom in the bond. In other words, rotation around the internuclear axis does not change the\nextent to which the σ bonding orbitals overlap because the bonding electron density is symmetric about the\naxis. Rotation about the internuclear axis is much more difficult for multiple bonds; however, this would\ndrastically alter the off-axis overlap of the π bonding orbitals, essentially breaking the π bond.\nIn molecules with sp hybrid orbitals, two unhybridized p orbitals remain on the atom (Figure 8.24). We find\nthis situation in acetylene,\nwhich is a linear molecule. The sp hybrid orbitals of the two carbon\natoms overlap end to end to form a σ bond between the carbon atoms (Figure 8.25). The remaining sp orbitals\nform σ bonds with hydrogen atoms. The two unhybridized p orbitals per carbon are positioned such that they\noverlap side by side and, hence, form two π bonds. The two carbon atoms of acetylene are thus bound together\nby one σ bond and two π bonds, giving a triple bond.\n8.3 • Multiple Bonds\n391",

However, many\nstructures also include resonance forms. Remember that resonance forms occur when various arrangements\nof π bonds are possible. Since the arrangement of π bonds involves only the unhybridized orbitals, resonance\ndoes not influence the assignment of hybridization.\nFor example, molecule benzene has two resonance forms (Figure 8.26). We can use either of these forms to\ndetermine that each of the carbon atoms is bonded to three other atoms with no lone pairs, so the correct\nhybridization is sp2.

There is an O=O double bond, and\neach oxygen atom has eight electrons around it. However, this picture is at odds with the magnetic behavior of\noxygen.

Thus, when we pour liquid oxygen\npast a strong magnet, it collects between the poles of the magnet and defies gravity, as in Figure 8.1.

When we compare\nthe weight of a sample to the weight measured in a magnetic field (Figure 8.27), paramagnetic samples that are\nattracted to the magnet will appear heavier because of the force exerted by the magnetic field.

Combining waves can lead to\nconstructive interference, in which peaks line up with peaks, or destructive interference, in which peaks line\nup with troughs (Figure 8.28). In orbitals, the waves are three dimensional, and they combine with in-phase\nwaves producing regions with a higher probability of electron density and out-of-phase waves producing\nnodes, or regions of no electron density.\nFIGURE 8.28\n(a) When in-phase waves combine, constructive interference produces a wave with greater\namplitude.

This interdisciplinary area of study uses\nbiology (understanding diseases and how they operate) to identify specific targets, such as a binding site that is\ninvolved in a disease pathway. By modeling the structures of the binding site and potential drugs,\ncomputational chemists can predict which structures can fit together and how effectively they will bind (see\nFigure 8.33). Thousands of potential candidates can be narrowed down to a few of the most promising\ncandidates. These candidate molecules are then carefully tested to determine side effects, how effectively they\ncan be transported through the body, and other factors. Dozens of important new pharmaceuticals have been\ndiscovered with the aid of computational chemistry, and new research projects are underway.\nFIGURE 8.33\nThe molecule shown, HIV-1 protease, is an important target for pharmaceutical research. By\ndesigning molecules that bind to this protein, scientists are able to drastically inhibit the progress of the disease.\nMolecular Orbital Energy Diagrams\nThe relative energy levels of atomic and molecular orbitals are typically shown in a molecular orbital diagram\n(Figure 8.34). For a diatomic molecule, the atomic orbitals of one atom are shown on the left, and those of the\nother atom are shown on the right.

Lower-energy orbitals fill first, electrons spread out among\ndegenerate orbitals before pairing, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins\n(Figure 8.34). Just as we write electron configurations for atoms, we can write the molecular electronic\nconfiguration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating the number of electrons present.

The molecular orbitals are filled in the same manner as atomic orbitals, using the\nAufbau principle and Hund’s rule.\nBond Order\nThe filled molecular orbital diagram shows the number of electrons in both bonding and antibonding\nmolecular orbitals. The net contribution of the electrons to the bond strength of a molecule is identified by\ndetermining the bond order that results from the filling of the molecular orbitals by electrons.\nWhen using Lewis structures to describe the distribution of electrons in molecules, we define bond order as\nthe number of bonding pairs of electrons between two atoms. Thus a single bond has a bond order of 1, a\ndouble bond has a bond order of 2, and a triple bond has a bond order of 3. We define bond order differently\nwhen we use the molecular orbital description of the distribution of electrons, but the resulting bond order is\nusually the same. The MO technique is more accurate and can handle cases when the Lewis structure method\nfails, but both methods describe the same phenomenon.\nIn the molecular orbital model, an electron contributes to a bonding interaction if it occupies a bonding orbital\nand it contributes to an antibonding interaction if it occupies an antibonding orbital. The bond order is\ncalculated by subtracting the destabilizing (antibonding) electrons from the stabilizing (bonding) electrons.\nSince a bond consists of two electrons, we divide by two to get the bond order. We can determine bond order\nwith the following equation:\nThe order of a covalent bond is a guide to its strength; a bond between two given atoms becomes stronger as\nthe bond order increases (Table 8.1). If the distribution of electrons in the molecular orbitals between two\natoms is such that the resulting bond would have a bond order of zero, a stable bond does not form. We next\nlook at some specific examples of MO diagrams and bond orders.\nBonding in Diatomic Molecules\nA dihydrogen molecule (H2) forms from two hydrogen atoms. When the atomic orbitals of the two atoms\ncombine, the electrons occupy the molecular orbital of lowest energy, the σ1s bonding orbital. A dihydrogen\nmolecule, H2, readily forms because the energy of a H2 molecule is lower than that of two H atoms. The σ1s\norbital that contains both electrons is lower in energy than either of the two 1s atomic orbitals.\nA molecular orbital can hold two electrons, so both electrons in the H2 molecule are in the σ1s bonding orbital;\nthe electron configuration is\nWe represent this configuration by a molecular orbital energy diagram\n(Figure 8.35) in which a single upward arrow indicates one electron in an orbital, and two (upward and\ndownward) arrows indicate two electrons of opposite spin.\n400\n8 • Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

However, we can predict that the Be2 molecule and the Ne2\nmolecule would not be stable.

Similarly, in molecular orbital theory, σ orbitals are usually more stable than π orbitals.\nHowever, this is not always the case. The MOs for the valence orbitals of the second period are shown in Figure\n8.37. Looking at Ne2 molecular orbitals, we see that the order is consistent with the generic diagram shown in\nthe previous section. However, for atoms with three or fewer electrons in the p orbitals (Li through N) we\nobserve a different pattern, in which the σp orbital is higher in energy than the πp set.

The\norbital energies decrease across the period as the effective nuclear charge increases and atomic radius decreases.\nBetween N2 and O2, the order of the orbitals changes.\nThis switch in orbital ordering occurs because of a phenomenon called s-p mixing. s-p mixing does not create\nnew orbitals; it merely influences the energies of the existing molecular orbitals. The σs wavefunction\nmathematically combines with the σp wavefunction, with the result that the σs orbital becomes more stable,\nand the σp orbital becomes less stable (Figure 8.38). Similarly, the antibonding orbitals also undergo s-p\nmixing, with the σs* becoming more stable and the σp* becoming less stable.\n402\n8 • Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Each of the two lithium atoms has one valence\nelectron. Hence, we have two valence electrons available for the σ2s bonding molecular orbital. Because both\nvalence electrons would be in a bonding orbital, we would predict the Li2 molecule to be stable. The molecule\nis, in fact, present in appreciable concentration in lithium vapor at temperatures near the boiling point of the\nelement. All of the other molecules in Table 8.3 with a bond order greater than zero are also known.\nThe O2 molecule has enough electrons to half fill the\nlevel. We expect the two electrons that\noccupy these two degenerate orbitals to be unpaired, and this molecular electronic configuration for O2 is in\naccord with the fact that the oxygen molecule has two unpaired electrons (Figure 8.40). The presence of two\nunpaired electrons has proved to be difficult to explain using Lewis structures, but the molecular orbital\ntheory explains it quite well. In fact, the unpaired electrons of the oxygen molecule provide a strong piece of\nsupport for the molecular orbital theory.\nHOW SCIENCES INTERCONNECT\nBand Theory\nWhen two identical atomic orbitals on different atoms combine, two molecular orbitals result (see Figure 8.29).\nThe bonding orbital is lower in energy than the original atomic orbitals because the atomic orbitals are in-\nphase in the molecular orbital. The antibonding orbital is higher in energy than the original atomic orbitals\nbecause the atomic orbitals are out-of-phase.\nIn a solid, similar things happen, but on a much larger scale. Remember that even in a small sample there are\na huge number of atoms (typically > 1023 atoms), and therefore a huge number of atomic orbitals that may be\ncombined into molecular orbitals. When N valence atomic orbitals, all of the same energy and each containing\none (1) electron, are combined, N/2 (filled) bonding orbitals and N/2 (empty) antibonding orbitals will result.\nEach bonding orbital will show an energy lowering as the atomic orbitals are mostly in-phase, but each of the\nbonding orbitals will be a little different and have slightly different energies. The antibonding orbitals will\nshow an increase in energy as the atomic orbitals are mostly out-of-phase, but each of the antibonding orbitals\nwill also be a little different and have slightly different energies. The allowed energy levels for all the bonding\norbitals are so close together that they form a band, called the valence band. Likewise, all the antibonding\norbitals are very close together and form a band, called the conduction band. Figure 8.39 shows the bands for\nthree important classes of materials: insulators, semiconductors, and conductors.\n404\n8 • Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

The type of solid is determined by the size of the\n“band gap” between the valence and conduction bands. Only a very small amount of energy is required to move\nelectrons from the valence band to the conduction band in a conductor, and so they conduct electricity well. In an\ninsulator, the band gap is large, so that very few electrons move, and they are poor conductors of electricity.\nSemiconductors are in between: they conduct electricity better than insulators, but not as well as conductors.\nIn order to conduct electricity, electrons must move from the filled valence band to the empty conduction band\nwhere they can move throughout the solid. The size of the band gap, or the energy difference between the top\nof the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band, determines how easy it is to move electrons\nbetween the bands. Only a small amount of energy is required in a conductor because the band gap is very\nsmall. This small energy difference is “easy” to overcome, so they are good conductors of electricity. In an\ninsulator, the band gap is so “large” that very few electrons move into the conduction band; as a result,\ninsulators are poor conductors of electricity. Semiconductors conduct electricity when “moderate” amounts of\nenergy are provided to move electrons out of the valence band and into the conduction band. Semiconductors,\nsuch as silicon, are found in many electronics.\nSemiconductors are used in devices such as computers, smartphones, and solar cells.

When they overlap in\na fashion that creates a node along this axis, they\nform a π bond.\n8.2 Hybrid Atomic Orbitals\nWe can use hybrid orbitals, which are mathematical\ncombinations of some or all of the valence atomic\norbitals, to describe the electron density around\ncovalently bonded atoms. These hybrid orbitals\neither form sigma (σ) bonds directed toward other\natoms of the molecule or contain lone pairs of\nelectrons. We can determine the type of\nhybridization around a central atom from the\ngeometry of the regions of electron density about it.\nTwo such regions imply sp hybridization; three, sp2\nhybridization; four, sp3 hybridization; five, sp3d\nhybridization; and six, sp3d2 hybridization. Pi (π)\nbonds are formed from unhybridized atomic orbitals\n(p or d orbitals).\n8.3 Multiple Bonds\nMultiple bonds consist of a σ bond located along the\naxis between two atoms and one or two π bonds. The\nσ bonds are usually formed by the overlap of\nhybridized atomic orbitals, while the π bonds are\nformed by the side-by-side overlap of unhybridized\norbitals. Resonance occurs when there are multiple\nunhybridized orbitals with the appropriate\nalignment to overlap, so the placement of π bonds\ncan vary.\n8.4 Molecular Orbital Theory\nMolecular orbital (MO) theory describes the behavior\nof electrons in a molecule in terms of combinations\nof the atomic wave functions. The resulting\nmolecular orbitals may extend over all the atoms in\nthe molecule. Bonding molecular orbitals are\nformed by in-phase combinations of atomic wave\nfunctions, and electrons in these orbitals stabilize a\nmolecule. Antibonding molecular orbitals result\nfrom out-of-phase combinations of atomic wave\nfunctions and electrons in these orbitals make a\nmolecule less stable. Molecular orbitals located\nalong an internuclear axis are called σ MOs. They\ncan be formed from s orbitals or from p orbitals\noriented in an end-to-end fashion. Molecular\norbitals formed from p orbitals oriented in a side-\nby-side fashion have electron density on opposite\nsides of the internuclear axis and are called π\norbitals.\nWe can describe the electronic structure of diatomic\nmolecules by applying molecular orbital theory to\nthe valence electrons of the atoms. Electrons fill\nmolecular orbitals following the same rules that\napply to filling atomic orbitals; Hund’s rule and the\nAufbau principle tell us that lower-energy orbitals\nwill fill first, electrons will spread out before they\npair up, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two\nelectrons with opposite spins. Materials with\nunpaired electrons are paramagnetic and attracted\nto a magnetic field, while those with all-paired\nelectrons are diamagnetic and repelled by a\nmagnetic field. Correctly predicting the magnetic\nproperties of molecules is in advantage of molecular\norbital theory over Lewis structures and valence\nbond theory.\nExercises\n8.1 Valence Bond Theory\n1.

Although we do not normally notice\natmospheric pressure, we are sensitive to pressure changes—for example, when your ears “pop” during take-\noff and landing while flying, or when you dive underwater. Gas pressure is caused by the force exerted by gas\nmolecules colliding with the surfaces of objects (Figure 9.2). Although the force of each collision is very small,\nany surface of appreciable area experiences a large number of collisions in a short time, which can result in a\nhigh pressure. In fact, normal air pressure is strong enough to crush a metal container when not balanced by\nequal pressure from inside the container.\nFIGURE 9.2\nThe atmosphere above us exerts a large pressure on objects at the surface of the earth, roughly equal\nto the weight of a bowling ball pressing on an area the size of a human thumbnail.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nA dramatic illustration (http://openstax.org/l/16atmospressur1) of atmospheric pressure is provided in this\nbrief video, which shows a railway tanker car imploding when its internal pressure is decreased.\nA smaller scale demonstration (http://openstax.org/l/16atmospressur2) of this phenomenon is briefly\nexplained.\nAtmospheric pressure is caused by the weight of the column of air molecules in the atmosphere above an\nobject, such as the tanker car. At sea level, this pressure is roughly the same as that exerted by a full-grown\nAfrican elephant standing on a doormat, or a typical bowling ball resting on your thumbnail. These may seem\nlike huge amounts, and they are, but life on earth has evolved under such atmospheric pressure. If you actually\nperch a bowling ball on your thumbnail, the pressure experienced is twice the usual pressure, and the\nsensation is unpleasant.\nIn general, pressure is defined as the force exerted on a given area:\nNote that pressure is directly\nproportional to force and inversely proportional to area. Thus, pressure can be increased either by increasing\nthe amount of force or by decreasing the area over which it is applied; pressure can be decreased by\ndecreasing the force or increasing the area.\nLet’s apply this concept to determine which exerts a greater pressure in Figure 9.3—the elephant or the figure\nskater? A large African elephant can weigh 7 tons, supported on four feet, each with a diameter of about 1.5 ft\n416\n9 • Gases\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

On the other hand, if the skater removes their skates and stands with bare feet (or regular\nfootwear) on the ice, the larger area over which their weight is applied greatly reduces the pressure exerted:\nFIGURE 9.3\nAlthough (a) an elephant’s weight is large, creating a very large force on the ground, (b) the figure\nskater exerts a much higher pressure on the ice due to the small surface area of the skates.

One pascal is a small pressure; in many cases, it is more convenient to use units of kilopascal (1 kPa =\n1000 Pa) or bar (1 bar = 100,000 Pa). In the United States, pressure is often measured in pounds of force on an\narea of one square inch—pounds per square inch (psi)—for example, in car tires. Pressure can also be\nmeasured using the unit atmosphere (atm), which originally represented the average sea level air pressure at\nthe approximate latitude of Paris (45°).

We now face complex weather and atmosphere-related challenges that will have a major impact on our\ncivilization and the ecosystem. Several different scientific disciplines use chemical principles to help us better\nunderstand weather, the atmosphere, and climate. These are meteorology, climatology, and atmospheric\nscience. Meteorology is the study of the atmosphere, atmospheric phenomena, and atmospheric effects on\nearth’s weather. Meteorologists seek to understand and predict the weather in the short term, which can save\nlives and benefit the economy. Weather forecasts (Figure 9.7) are the result of thousands of measurements of\nair pressure, temperature, and the like, which are compiled, modeled, and analyzed in weather centers\nworldwide.\nChemistry in Everyday Life\nMeasuring Blood Pressure\nBlood pressure is measured using a device called a sphygmomanometer (Greek sphygmos = “pulse”). It\nconsists of an inflatable cuff to restrict blood flow, a manometer to measure the pressure, and a method of\ndetermining when blood flow begins and when it becomes impeded (Figure 9.6). Since its invention in\n1881, it has been an essential medical device. There are many types of sphygmomanometers: manual ones\nthat require a stethoscope and are used by medical professionals; mercury ones, used when the most\naccuracy is required; less accurate mechanical ones; and digital ones that can be used with little training\nbut that have limitations. When using a sphygmomanometer, the cuff is placed around the upper arm and\ninflated until blood flow is completely blocked, then slowly released. As the heart beats, blood forced\nthrough the arteries causes a rise in pressure. This rise in pressure at which blood flow begins is the\nsystolic pressure—the peak pressure in the cardiac cycle. When the cuff’s pressure equals the arterial\nsystolic pressure, blood flows past the cuff, creating audible sounds that can be heard using a stethoscope.\nThis is followed by a decrease in pressure as the heart’s ventricles prepare for another beat. As cuff\npressure continues to decrease, eventually sound is no longer heard; this is the diastolic pressure—the\nlowest pressure (resting phase) in the cardiac cycle. Blood pressure units from a sphygmomanometer are\nin terms of millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).\nFIGURE 9.6\n(a) A medical technician prepares to measure a patient’s blood pressure with a\nsphygmomanometer.

Movement of moisture and air\nwithin various weather fronts instigates most weather events.\nThe atmosphere is the gaseous layer that surrounds a planet. Earth’s atmosphere, which is roughly 100–125\nkm thick, consists of roughly 78.1% nitrogen and 21.0% oxygen, and can be subdivided further into the\nregions shown in Figure 9.8: the exosphere (furthest from earth, > 700 km above sea level), the thermosphere\n(80–700 km), the mesosphere (50–80 km), the stratosphere (second lowest level of our atmosphere, 12–50 km\nabove sea level), and the troposphere (up to 12 km above sea level, roughly 80% of the earth’s atmosphere by\nmass and the layer where most weather events originate).

Although their measurements were not precise by today’s standards, they were able to\ndetermine the mathematical relationships between pairs of these variables (e.g., pressure and temperature,\npressure and volume) that hold for an ideal gas—a hypothetical construct that real gases approximate under\ncertain conditions. Eventually, these individual laws were combined into a single equation—the ideal gas\nlaw—that relates gas quantities for gases and is quite accurate for low pressures and moderate temperatures.\nWe will consider the key developments in individual relationships (for pedagogical reasons not quite in\nhistorical order), then put them together in the ideal gas law.\nFIGURE 9.9\nIn 1783, the first (a) hydrogen-filled balloon flight, (b) manned hot air balloon flight, and (c) manned\nhydrogen-filled balloon flight occurred. When the hydrogen-filled balloon depicted in (a) landed, the frightened\nvillagers of Gonesse reportedly destroyed it with pitchforks and knives. The launch of the latter was reportedly\nviewed by 400,000 people in Paris.\nPressure and Temperature: Amontons’s Law\nImagine filling a rigid container attached to a pressure gauge with gas and then sealing the container so that no\ngas may escape. If the container is cooled, the gas inside likewise gets colder and its pressure is observed to\ndecrease. Since the container is rigid and tightly sealed, both the volume and number of moles of gas remain\nconstant. If we heat the sphere, the gas inside gets hotter (Figure 9.10) and the pressure increases.\n9.2 • Relating Pressure, Volume, Amount, and Temperature: The Ideal Gas Law\n425",

An example of experimental pressure-temperature data is shown for a sample of air under these\nconditions in Figure 9.11. We find that temperature and pressure are linearly related, and if the temperature is\non the kelvin scale, then P and T are directly proportional (again, when volume and moles of gas are held\nconstant); if the temperature on the kelvin scale increases by a certain factor, the gas pressure increases by the\nsame factor.\nFIGURE 9.11\nFor a constant volume and amount of air, the pressure and temperature are directly proportional,\nprovided the temperature is in kelvin. (Measurements cannot be made at lower temperatures because of the\ncondensation of the gas.) When this line is extrapolated to lower pressures, it reaches a pressure of 0 at –273 °C,\nwhich is 0 on the kelvin scale and the lowest possible temperature, called absolute zero.\nGuillaume Amontons was the first to empirically establish the relationship between the pressure and the\ntemperature of a gas (~1700), and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac determined the relationship more precisely\n(~1800). Because of this, the P-T relationship for gases is known as either Amontons’s law or Gay-Lussac’s\nlaw. Under either name, it states that the pressure of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to its\ntemperature on the kelvin scale when the volume is held constant.

The answer, of course, is respiration, or breathing. How does it work? It turns out that the gas\nlaws apply here. Your lungs take in gas that your body needs (oxygen) and get rid of waste gas (carbon\ndioxide). Lungs are made of spongy, stretchy tissue that expands and contracts while you breathe. When\nyou inhale, your diaphragm and intercostal muscles (the muscles between your ribs) contract, expanding\nyour chest cavity and making your lung volume larger. The increase in volume leads to a decrease in\npressure (Boyle’s law). This causes air to flow into the lungs (from high pressure to low pressure). When you\nexhale, the process reverses: Your diaphragm and rib muscles relax, your chest cavity contracts, and your\nlung volume decreases, causing the pressure to increase (Boyle’s law again), and air flows out of the lungs\n(from high pressure to low pressure). You then breathe in and out again, and again, repeating this Boyle’s\nlaw cycle for the rest of your life (Figure 9.15).\nFIGURE 9.15\nBreathing occurs because expanding and contracting lung volume creates small pressure\ndifferences between your lungs and your surroundings, causing air to be drawn into and forced out of your lungs.\n432\n9 • Gases\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Over time, this relationship was supported by many experimental\nobservations as expressed by Avogadro’s law: For a confined gas, the volume (V) and number of moles (n) are\ndirectly proportional if the pressure and temperature both remain constant.\nIn equation form, this is written as:\nMathematical relationships can also be determined for the other variable pairs, such as P versus n, and n\nversus T.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit this interactive PhET simulation (http://openstax.org/l/16IdealGasLaw) to investigate the relationships\nbetween pressure, volume, temperature, and amount of gas. Use the simulation to examine the effect of\nchanging one parameter on another while holding the other parameters constant (as described in the\npreceding sections on the various gas laws).\nThe Ideal Gas Law\nTo this point, four separate laws have been discussed that relate pressure, volume, temperature, and the\nnumber of moles of the gas:\n•\nBoyle’s law: PV = constant at constant T and n\n•\nAmontons’s law:\n= constant at constant V and n\n•\nCharles’s law:\n= constant at constant P and n\n•\nAvogadro’s law:\n= constant at constant P and T\nCombining these four laws yields the ideal gas law, a relation between the pressure, volume, temperature, and\nnumber of moles of a gas:\nwhere P is the pressure of a gas, V is its volume, n is the number of moles of the gas, T is its temperature on the\nkelvin scale, and R is a constant called the ideal gas constant or the universal gas constant. The units used to\nexpress pressure, volume, and temperature will determine the proper form of the gas constant as required by\ndimensional analysis, the most commonly encountered values being 0.08206 L atm mol–1 K–1 and 8.314 kPa L\nmol–1 K–1.\nGases whose properties of P, V, and T are accurately described by the ideal gas law (or the other gas laws) are\nsaid to exhibit ideal behavior or to approximate the traits of an ideal gas. An ideal gas is a hypothetical\nconstruct that may be used along with kinetic molecular theory to effectively explain the gas laws as will be\ndescribed in a later module of this chapter. Although all the calculations presented in this module assume\nideal behavior, this assumption is only reasonable for gases under conditions of relatively low pressure and\nhigh temperature. In the final module of this chapter, a modified gas law will be introduced that accounts for\nthe non-ideal behavior observed for many gases at relatively high pressures and low temperatures.\nThe ideal gas equation contains five terms, the gas constant R and the variable properties P, V, n, and T.\nSpecifying any four of these terms will permit use of the ideal gas law to calculate the fifth term as\ndemonstrated in the following example exercises.\n9.2 • Relating Pressure, Volume, Amount, and Temperature: The Ideal Gas Law\n433",

Chemists sometimes make comparisons against a\nstandard temperature and pressure (STP) for reporting properties of gases: 273.15 K and 1 atm (101.325\nkPa).1 At STP, one mole of an ideal gas has a volume of about 22.4 L—this is referred to as the standard molar\nvolume (Figure 9.18).\nFIGURE 9.17\nScuba divers, whether at the Great Barrier Reef or in the Caribbean, must be aware of buoyancy,\npressure equalization, and the amount of time they spend underwater, to avoid the risks associated with\npressurized gases in the body. (credit: Kyle Taylor)\nPressure increases with ocean depth, and the pressure changes most rapidly as divers reach the surface.\nThe pressure a diver experiences is the sum of all pressures above the diver (from the water and the air).\nMost pressure measurements are given in units of atmospheres, expressed as “atmospheres absolute” or\nATA in the diving community: Every 33 feet of salt water represents 1 ATA of pressure in addition to 1 ATA\nof pressure from the atmosphere at sea level. As a diver descends, the increase in pressure causes the\nbody’s air pockets in the ears and lungs to compress; on the ascent, the decrease in pressure causes these\nair pockets to expand, potentially rupturing eardrums or bursting the lungs. Divers must therefore\nundergo equalization by adding air to body airspaces on the descent by breathing normally and adding air\nto the mask by breathing out of the nose or adding air to the ears and sinuses by equalization techniques;\nthe corollary is also true on ascent, divers must release air from the body to maintain equalization.\nBuoyancy, or the ability to control whether a diver sinks or floats, is controlled by the buoyancy\ncompensator (BCD). If a diver is ascending, the air in their BCD expands because of lower pressure\naccording to Boyle’s law (decreasing the pressure of gases increases the volume). The expanding air\nincreases the buoyancy of the diver, and they begin to ascend. The diver must vent air from the BCD or risk\nan uncontrolled ascent that could rupture the lungs. In descending, the increased pressure causes the air\nin the BCD to compress and the diver sinks much more quickly; the diver must add air to the BCD or risk an\nuncontrolled descent, facing much higher pressures near the ocean floor. The pressure also impacts how\nlong a diver can stay underwater before ascending. The deeper a diver dives, the more compressed the air\nthat is breathed because of increased pressure: If a diver dives 33 feet, the pressure is 2 ATA and the air\nwould be compressed to one-half of its original volume. The diver uses up available air twice as fast as at\nthe surface.\n1\nThe IUPAC definition of standard pressure was changed from 1 atm to 1 bar (100 kPa) in 1982, but the prior definition remains in\nuse by many literature resources and will be used in this text.\n436\n9 • Gases\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

He\ndiscovered the law of conservation of matter, discovered the role of oxygen in combustion reactions,\ndetermined the composition of air, explained respiration in terms of chemical reactions, and more. He was a\ncasualty of the French Revolution, guillotined in 1794. Of his death, mathematician and astronomer Joseph-\nLouis Lagrange said, “It took the mob only a moment to remove his head; a century will not suffice to\nreproduce it.”2 Much of the knowledge we do have about Lavoisier's contributions is due to his wife, Marie-\nAnne Paulze Lavoisier, who worked with him in his lab. A trained artist fluent in several languages, she created\ndetailed illustrations of the equipment in his lab, and translated texts from foreign scientists to complement\nhis knowledge. After his execution, she was instrumental in publishing Lavoisier's major treatise, which\nunified many concepts of chemistry and laid the groundwork for significant further study.\nAs described in an earlier chapter of this text, we can turn to chemical stoichiometry for answers to many of\nthe questions that ask “How much?” The essential property involved in such use of stoichiometry is the\namount of substance, typically measured in moles (n). For gases, molar amount can be derived from\nconvenient experimental measurements of pressure, temperature, and volume. Therefore, these\nmeasurements are useful in assessing the stoichiometry of pure gases, gas mixtures, and chemical reactions\ninvolving gases.

If we know\nthe volume, pressure, and temperature of a gas, we can use the ideal gas equation to calculate how many moles\nof the gas are present. If we know how many moles of a gas are involved, we can calculate the volume of a gas at\nany temperature and pressure.\nAvogadro’s Law Revisited\nSometimes we can take advantage of a simplifying feature of the stoichiometry of gases that solids and\nsolutions do not exhibit: All gases that show ideal behavior contain the same number of molecules in the same\nvolume (at the same temperature and pressure). Thus, the ratios of volumes of gases involved in a chemical\nreaction are given by the coefficients in the equation for the reaction, provided that the gas volumes are\nmeasured at the same temperature and pressure.\nWe can extend Avogadro’s law (that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of the\ngas) to chemical reactions with gases: Gases combine, or react, in definite and simple proportions by volume,\nprovided that all gas volumes are measured at the same temperature and pressure. For example, since\nnitrogen and hydrogen gases react to produce ammonia gas according to\na\ngiven volume of nitrogen gas reacts with three times that volume of hydrogen gas to produce two times that\nvolume of ammonia gas, if pressure and temperature remain constant.\nThe explanation for this is illustrated in Figure 9.23. According to Avogadro’s law, equal volumes of gaseous N2,\nH2, and NH3, at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules. Because one\nmolecule of N2 reacts with three molecules of H2 to produce two molecules of NH3, the volume of H2 required\nis three times the volume of N2, and the volume of NH3 produced is two times the volume of N2.\nFIGURE 9.23\nOne volume of N2 combines with three volumes of H2 to form two volumes of NH3.\n9.3 • Stoichiometry of Gaseous Substances, Mixtures, and Reactions\n445",

In fact, this is\ndue to less than 0.5% of the air molecules. Of the energy from the sun that reaches the earth, almost\nis\nreflected back into space, with the rest absorbed by the atmosphere and the surface of the earth. Some of the\nenergy that the earth absorbs is re-emitted as infrared (IR) radiation, a portion of which passes back out\nthrough the atmosphere into space. Most if this IR radiation, however, is absorbed by certain atmospheric\ngases, effectively trapping heat within the atmosphere in a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. This\neffect maintains global temperatures within the range needed to sustain life on earth. Without our\natmosphere, the earth's average temperature would be lower by more than 30 °C (nearly 60 °F). The major\ngreenhouse gases (GHGs) are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and ozone. Since the Industrial\nRevolution, human activity has been increasing the concentrations of GHGs, which have changed the energy\nbalance and are significantly altering the earth’s climate (Figure 9.24).\n9.3 • Stoichiometry of Gaseous Substances, Mixtures, and Reactions\n447",

Although gaseous molecules travel at tremendous speeds (hundreds of meters per second),\nthey collide with other gaseous molecules and travel in many different directions before reaching the desired\ntarget. At room temperature, a gaseous molecule will experience billions of collisions per second. The mean\nfree path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. The mean free path increases with\ndecreasing pressure; in general, the mean free path for a gaseous molecule will be hundreds of times the\ndiameter of the molecule\nIn general, we know that when a sample of gas is introduced to one part of a closed container, its molecules\nvery quickly disperse throughout the container; this process by which molecules disperse in space in response\nto differences in concentration is called diffusion (shown in Figure 9.27). The gaseous atoms or molecules are,\nof course, unaware of any concentration gradient, they simply move randomly—regions of higher\nconcentration have more particles than regions of lower concentrations, and so a net movement of species\nfrom high to low concentration areas takes place. In a closed environment, diffusion will ultimately result in\nequal concentrations of gas throughout, as depicted in Figure 9.27. The gaseous atoms and molecules continue\nto move, but since their concentrations are the same in both bulbs, the rates of transfer between the bulbs are\nequal (no net transfer of molecules occurs).\nFIGURE 9.27\n(a) Two gases, H2 and O2, are initially separated.

(c) After a short time, both the slower-\nmoving O2 molecules and the faster-moving H2 molecules have distributed themselves evenly on both sides of the\nvessel.\nWe are often interested in the rate of diffusion, the amount of gas passing through some area per unit time:\nThe diffusion rate depends on several factors: the concentration gradient (the increase or decrease in\nconcentration from one point to another); the amount of surface area available for diffusion; and the distance\nthe gas particles must travel. Note also that the time required for diffusion to occur is inversely proportional to\nthe rate of diffusion, as shown in the rate of diffusion equation.\nA process involving movement of gaseous species similar to diffusion is effusion, the escape of gas molecules\nthrough a tiny hole such as a pinhole in a balloon into a vacuum (Figure 9.28). Although diffusion and effusion\nrates both depend on the molar mass of the gas involved, their rates are not equal; however, the ratios of their\nrates are the same.\nFIGURE 9.28\nDiffusion involves the unrestricted dispersal of molecules throughout space due to their random\nmotion.

Nuclear reactors require fuel that is 2–5% 235U, and nuclear\nbombs need even higher concentrations. One way to enrich uranium to the desired levels is to take advantage\nof Graham’s law. In a gaseous diffusion enrichment plant, uranium hexafluoride (UF6, the only uranium\ncompound that is volatile enough to work) is slowly pumped through large cylindrical vessels called diffusers,\nwhich contain porous barriers with microscopic openings. The process is one of diffusion because the other\nside of the barrier is not evacuated. The 235UF6 molecules have a higher average speed and diffuse through the\nbarrier a little faster than the heavier 238UF6 molecules. The gas that has passed through the barrier is slightly\nenriched in 235UF6 and the residual gas is slightly depleted. The small difference in molecular weights between\n235UF6 and 238UF6 only about 0.4% enrichment, is achieved in one diffuser (Figure 9.30). But by connecting\nmany diffusers in a sequence of stages (called a cascade), the desired level of enrichment can be attained.\nFIGURE 9.30\nIn a diffuser, gaseous UF6 is pumped through a porous barrier, which partially separates 235UF6 from\n238UF6 The UF6 must pass through many large diffuser units to achieve sufficient enrichment in 235U.\nThe large scale separation of gaseous 235UF6 from 238UF6 was first done during the World War II, at the atomic\nenergy installation in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, as part of the Manhattan Project (the development of the first\natomic bomb). Although the theory is simple, this required surmounting many daunting technical challenges\nto make it work in practice. The barrier must have tiny, uniform holes (about 10–6 cm in diameter) and be\nporous enough to produce high flow rates.

The mathematical forms of these laws closely describe the\nmacroscopic behavior of most gases at pressures less than about 1 or 2 atm. Although the gas laws describe\nrelationships that have been verified by many experiments, they do not tell us why gases follow these\nrelationships.\nThe kinetic molecular theory (KMT) is a simple microscopic model that effectively explains the gas laws\ndescribed in previous modules of this chapter. This theory is based on the following five postulates described\nhere. (Note: The term “molecule” will be used to refer to the individual chemical species that compose the gas,\nalthough some gases are composed of atomic species, for example, the noble gases.)\n1.\nGases are composed of molecules that are in continuous motion, travelling in straight lines and changing\ndirection only when they collide with other molecules or with the walls of a container.\n2.\nThe molecules composing the gas are negligibly small compared to the distances between them.\n3.\nThe pressure exerted by a gas in a container results from collisions between the gas molecules and the\ncontainer walls.\n4.\nGas molecules exert no attractive or repulsive forces on each other or the container walls; therefore, their\ncollisions are elastic (do not involve a loss of energy).\n5.\nThe average kinetic energy of the gas molecules is proportional to the kelvin temperature of the gas.\nThe test of the KMT and its postulates is its ability to explain and describe the behavior of a gas. The various\ngas laws can be derived from the assumptions of the KMT, which have led chemists to believe that the\nassumptions of the theory accurately represent the properties of gas molecules. We will first look at the\nindividual gas laws (Boyle’s, Charles’s, Amontons’s, Avogadro’s, and Dalton’s laws) conceptually to see how the\nKMT explains them. Then, we will more carefully consider the relationships between molecular masses,\nspeeds, and kinetic energies with temperature, and explain Graham’s law.\nThe Kinetic-Molecular Theory Explains the Behavior of Gases, Part I\nRecalling that gas pressure is exerted by rapidly moving gas molecules and depends directly on the number of\nmolecules hitting a unit area of the wall per unit of time, we see that the KMT conceptually explains the\nbehavior of a gas as follows:\n•\nAmontons’s law. If the temperature is increased, the average speed and kinetic energy of the gas\nmolecules increase. If the volume is held constant, the increased speed of the gas molecules results in\nmore frequent and more forceful collisions with the walls of the container, therefore increasing the\npressure (Figure 9.31).\n•\nCharles’s law. If the temperature of a gas is increased, a constant pressure may be maintained only if the\nvolume occupied by the gas increases. This will result in greater average distances traveled by the\nmolecules to reach the container walls, as well as increased wall surface area. These conditions will\ndecrease the both the frequency of molecule-wall collisions and the number of collisions per unit area, the\ncombined effects of which balance the effect of increased collision forces due to the greater kinetic energy\nat the higher temperature.\n•\nBoyle’s law. If the gas volume volume of a given amount of gas at a given temperature is decreased (that is,\nif the gas is compressed), the molecules will be exposed to a decreased container wall area.

The postulates of this theory may be applied in a more quantitative fashion to derive these individual\nlaws. To do this, we must first look at speeds and kinetic energies of gas molecules, and the temperature of a\ngas sample.\nIn a gas sample, individual molecules have widely varying speeds; however, because of the vast number of\nmolecules and collisions involved, the molecular speed distribution and average speed are constant. This\nmolecular speed distribution is known as a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and it depicts the relative\nnumbers of molecules in a bulk sample of gas that possesses a given speed (Figure 9.32).\n9.5 • The Kinetic-Molecular Theory\n455",

As mentioned in the previous modules of this chapter, however, the behavior of a gas is often\nnon-ideal, meaning that the observed relationships between its pressure, volume, and temperature are not\naccurately described by the gas laws. In this section, the reasons for these deviations from ideal gas behavior\nare considered.\nOne way in which the accuracy of PV = nRT can be judged is by comparing the actual volume of 1 mole of gas\n(its molar volume, Vm) to the molar volume of an ideal gas at the same temperature and pressure. This ratio is\ncalled the compressibility factor (Z) with:\nIdeal gas behavior is therefore indicated when this ratio is equal to 1, and any deviation from 1 is an indication\nof non-ideal behavior. Figure 9.35 shows plots of Z over a large pressure range for several common gases.\nFIGURE 9.35\nA graph of the compressibility factor (Z) vs. pressure shows that gases can exhibit significant\ndeviations from the behavior predicted by the ideal gas law.\nAs is apparent from Figure 9.35, the ideal gas law does not describe gas behavior well at relatively high\npressures. To determine why this is, consider the differences between real gas properties and what is expected\nof a hypothetical ideal gas.\nParticles of a hypothetical ideal gas have no significant volume and do not attract or repel each other. In\ngeneral, real gases approximate this behavior at relatively low pressures and high temperatures. However, at\nhigh pressures, the molecules of a gas are crowded closer together, and the amount of empty space between\nthe molecules is reduced. At these higher pressures, the volume of the gas molecules themselves becomes\nappreciable relative to the total volume occupied by the gas. The gas therefore becomes less compressible at\nthese high pressures, and although its volume continues to decrease with increasing pressure, this decrease is\nnot proportional as predicted by Boyle’s law.\nAt relatively low pressures, gas molecules have practically no attraction for one another because they are (on\naverage) so far apart, and they behave almost like particles of an ideal gas. At higher pressures, however, the\nforce of attraction is also no longer insignificant. This force pulls the molecules a little closer together, slightly\ndecreasing the pressure (if the volume is constant) or decreasing the volume (at constant pressure) (Figure\n9.36). This change is more pronounced at low temperatures because the molecules have lower KE relative to\nthe attractive forces, and so they are less effective in overcoming these attractions after colliding with one\nanother.\n9.6 • Non-Ideal Gas Behavior\n459",

(b) These attractive forces will decrease\nthe force of collisions between the molecules and container walls, therefore reducing the pressure exerted at\nconstant volume compared to an ideal gas.\nThere are several different equations that better approximate gas behavior than does the ideal gas law. The\nfirst, and simplest, of these was developed by the Dutch scientist Johannes van der Waals in 1879. The van der\nWaals equation improves upon the ideal gas law by adding two terms: one to account for the volume of the gas\nmolecules and another for the attractive forces between them.\nThe constant a corresponds to the strength of the attraction between molecules of a particular gas, and the\nconstant b corresponds to the size of the molecules of a particular gas. The “correction” to the pressure term in\nthe ideal gas law is\nand the “correction” to the volume is nb. Note that when V is relatively large and n is\nrelatively small, both of these correction terms become negligible, and the van der Waals equation reduces to\nthe ideal gas law, PV = nRT. Such a condition corresponds to a gas in which a relatively low number of\nmolecules is occupying a relatively large volume, that is, a gas at a relatively low pressure.

          "text": "At low pressures, the correction for intermolecular attraction, a, is more important than the one for molecular\nvolume, b. At high pressures and small volumes, the correction for the volume of the molecules becomes\nimportant because the molecules themselves are incompressible and constitute an appreciable fraction of the\ntotal volume. At some intermediate pressure, the two corrections have opposing influences and the gas\nappears to follow the relationship given by PV = nRT over a small range of pressures. This behavior is reflected\nby the “dips” in several of the compressibility curves shown in Figure 9.35. The attractive force between\nmolecules initially makes the gas more compressible than an ideal gas, as pressure is raised (Z decreases with\nincreasing P). At very high pressures, the gas becomes less compressible (Z increases with P), as the gas\nmolecules begin to occupy an increasingly significant fraction of the total gas volume.\nStrictly speaking, the ideal gas equation functions well when intermolecular attractions between gas\nmolecules are negligible and the gas molecules themselves do not occupy an appreciable part of the whole\nvolume. These criteria are satisfied under conditions of low pressure and high temperature. Under such\nconditions, the gas is said to behave ideally, and deviations from the gas laws are small enough that they may\nbe disregarded—this is, however, very often not the case.\nEXAMPLE 9.24\nComparison of Ideal Gas Law and van der Waals Equation\nA 4.25-L flask contains 3.46 mol CO2 at 229 °C.

The pressure of a given amount of gas is\ndirectly proportional to its absolute temperature,\nprovided that the volume does not change\n(Amontons’s law). The volume of a given gas sample\nis directly proportional to its absolute temperature\nat constant pressure (Charles’s law). The volume of a\ngiven amount of gas is inversely proportional to its\npressure when temperature is held constant (Boyle’s\nlaw). Under the same conditions of temperature and\npressure, equal volumes of all gases contain the\nsame number of molecules (Avogadro’s law).\nThe equations describing these laws are special\ncases of the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, where P is the\npressure of the gas, V is its volume, n is the number\nof moles of the gas, T is its kelvin temperature, and R\nis the ideal (universal) gas constant.\n9.3 Stoichiometry of Gaseous Substances,\nMixtures, and Reactions\nThe ideal gas law can be used to derive a number of\nconvenient equations relating directly measured\nquantities to properties of interest for gaseous\nsubstances and mixtures. Appropriate\nrearrangement of the ideal gas equation may be\nmade to permit the calculation of gas densities and\nmolar masses. Dalton’s law of partial pressures may\nbe used to relate measured gas pressures for\ngaseous mixtures to their compositions. Avogadro’s\nlaw may be used in stoichiometric computations for\nchemical reactions involving gaseous reactants or\nproducts.\n9.4 Effusion and Diffusion of Gases\nGaseous atoms and molecules move freely and\nrandomly through space. Diffusion is the process\nwhereby gaseous atoms and molecules are\ntransferred from regions of relatively high\nconcentration to regions of relatively low\nconcentration. Effusion is a similar process in which\ngaseous species pass from a container to a vacuum\nthrough very small orifices. The rates of effusion of\ngases are inversely proportional to the square roots\nof their densities or to the square roots of their\natoms/molecules’ masses (Graham’s law).\n9.5 The Kinetic-Molecular Theory\nThe kinetic molecular theory is a simple but very\neffective model that effectively explains ideal gas\nbehavior. The theory assumes that gases consist of\nwidely separated molecules of negligible volume\nthat are in constant motion, colliding elastically with\none another and the walls of their container with\naverage speeds determined by their absolute\ntemperatures.

Aside from the\nsymptoms and complications of the illness, its social stigma led sufferers to be cast out of communities and\nisolated in colonies; in some regions this practice lasted well into the twentieth century. At that time, the best\npotential treatment for leprosy was oil from the chaulmoogra tree, but the oil was extremely thick, causing\nblisters and making usage painful and ineffective. Healthcare professionals seeking a better application\ncontacted Alice Ball, a young chemist at the University of Hawaii, who had focused her masters thesis on a\nsimilar plant. Ball initiated a sequence of procedures (repeated acidification and purification to change the\ncharacteristics of the oil and isolate the active substances (esters, discussed later in this text). The \"Ball\nMethod\" as it later came to be called, became the standard treatment for leprosy for decades. In the liquid and\nsolid states, atomic and molecular interactions are of considerable strength and play an important role in\ndetermining a number of physical properties of the substance. For example, the thickness, or viscosity, of the\nchaulmoogra oil was due to its intermolecular forces. In this chapter, the nature of these interactions and their\neffects on various physical properties of liquid and solid phases will be examined.\nFigure 10.1\nSolid carbon dioxide (“dry ice”, left) sublimes vigorously when placed in a liquid (right), cooling the\nliquid and generating a dense mist of water above the cylinder.

          "text": "10.1 Intermolecular Forces\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the types of intermolecular forces possible between atoms or molecules in condensed phases\n(dispersion forces, dipole-dipole attractions, and hydrogen bonding)\n•\nIdentify the types of intermolecular forces experienced by specific molecules based on their structures\n•\nExplain the relation between the intermolecular forces present within a substance and the temperatures\nassociated with changes in its physical state\nAs was the case for gaseous substances, the kinetic molecular theory may be used to explain the behavior of\nsolids and liquids. In the following description, the term particle will be used to refer to an atom, molecule, or\nion. Note that we will use the popular phrase “intermolecular attraction” to refer to attractive forces between\nthe particles of a substance, regardless of whether these particles are molecules, atoms, or ions.\nConsider these two aspects of the molecular-level environments in solid, liquid, and gaseous matter:\n•\nParticles in a solid are tightly packed together and often arranged in a regular pattern; in a liquid, they are\nclose together with no regular arrangement; in a gas, they are far apart with no regular arrangement.\n•\nParticles in a solid vibrate about fixed positions and do not generally move in relation to one another; in a\nliquid, they move past each other but remain in essentially constant contact; in a gas, they move\nindependently of one another except when they collide.\nThe differences in the properties of a solid, liquid, or gas reflect the strengths of the attractive forces between\nthe atoms, molecules, or ions that make up each phase. The phase in which a substance exists depends on the\nrelative extents of its intermolecular forces (IMFs) and the kinetic energies (KE) of its molecules. IMFs are the\nvarious forces of attraction that may exist between the atoms and molecules of a substance due to electrostatic\nphenomena, as will be detailed in this module. These forces serve to hold particles close together, whereas the\nparticles’ KE provides the energy required to overcome the attractive forces and thus increase the distance\nbetween particles. Figure 10.2 illustrates how changes in physical state may be induced by changing the\ntemperature, hence, the average KE, of a given substance.\nFIGURE 10.2\nTransitions between solid, liquid, and gaseous states of a substance occur when conditions of\ntemperature or pressure favor the associated changes in intermolecular forces. (Note: The space between particles\nin the gas phase is much greater than shown.)\nAs an example of the processes depicted in this figure, consider a sample of water. When gaseous water is\ncooled sufficiently, the attractions between H2O molecules will be capable of holding them together when they\ncome into contact with each other; the gas condenses, forming liquid H2O. For example, liquid water forms on\nthe outside of a cold glass as the water vapor in the air is cooled by the cold glass, as seen in Figure 10.3.\n476\n10 • Liquids and Solids\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

          "text": "Forces between Molecules\nUnder appropriate conditions, the attractions between all gas molecules will cause them to form liquids or\nsolids. This is due to intermolecular forces, not intramolecular forces. Intramolecular forces are those within\nthe molecule that keep the molecule together, for example, the bonds between the atoms. Intermolecular\nforces are the attractions between molecules, which determine many of the physical properties of a substance.\nFigure 10.5 illustrates these different molecular forces. The strengths of these attractive forces vary widely,\nthough usually the IMFs between small molecules are weak compared to the intramolecular forces that bond\natoms together within a molecule. For example, to overcome the IMFs in one mole of liquid HCl and convert it\ninto gaseous HCl requires only about 17 kilojoules. However, to break the covalent bonds between the\nhydrogen and chlorine atoms in one mole of HCl requires about 25 times more energy—430 kilojoules.\nFIGURE 10.5\nIntramolecular forces keep a molecule intact. Intermolecular forces hold multiple molecules\ntogether and determine many of a substance’s properties.\nAll of the attractive forces between neutral atoms and molecules are known as van der Waals forces, although\nthey are usually referred to more informally as intermolecular attraction. We will consider the various types of\nIMFs in the next three sections of this module.\nDispersion Forces\nOne of the three van der Waals forces is present in all condensed phases, regardless of the nature of the atoms\nor molecules composing the substance. This attractive force is called the London dispersion force in honor of\nGerman-born American physicist Fritz London who, in 1928, first explained it. This force is often referred to as\nsimply the dispersion force. Because the electrons of an atom or molecule are in constant motion (or,\nalternatively, the electron’s location is subject to quantum-mechanical variability), at any moment in time, an\natom or molecule can develop a temporary, instantaneous dipole if its electrons are distributed\nasymmetrically. The presence of this dipole can, in turn, distort the electrons of a neighboring atom or\nmolecule, producing an induced dipole. These two rapidly fluctuating, temporary dipoles thus result in a\nrelatively weak electrostatic attraction between the species—a so-called dispersion force like that illustrated in\nFigure 10.6.\nFIGURE 10.6\nDispersion forces result from the formation of temporary dipoles, as illustrated here for two nonpolar\ndiatomic molecules.\nDispersion forces that develop between atoms in different molecules can attract the two molecules to each\nother. The forces are relatively weak, however, and become significant only when the molecules are very close.\n478\n10 • Liquids and Solids\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

In a larger atom, the valence electrons are, on average, farther from the nuclei\nthan in a smaller atom. Thus, they are less tightly held and can more easily form the temporary dipoles that\nproduce the attraction. The measure of how easy or difficult it is for another electrostatic charge (for example,\na nearby ion or polar molecule) to distort a molecule’s charge distribution (its electron cloud) is known as\npolarizability. A molecule that has a charge cloud that is easily distorted is said to be very polarizable and will\nhave large dispersion forces; one with a charge cloud that is difficult to distort is not very polarizable and will\nhave small dispersion forces.\nEXAMPLE 10.1\nLondon Forces and Their Effects\nOrder the following compounds of a group 14 element and hydrogen from lowest to highest boiling point: CH4,\nSiH4, GeH4, and SnH4. Explain your reasoning.\nSolution\nApplying the skills acquired in the chapter on chemical bonding and molecular geometry, all of these\ncompounds are predicted to be nonpolar, so they may experience only dispersion forces: the smaller the\nmolecule, the less polarizable and the weaker the dispersion forces; the larger the molecule, the larger the\ndispersion forces. The molar masses of CH4, SiH4, GeH4, and SnH4 are approximately 16 g/mol, 32 g/mol, 77 g/\nmol, and 123 g/mol, respectively. Therefore, CH4 is expected to have the lowest boiling point and SnH4 the\nhighest boiling point. The ordering from lowest to highest boiling point is expected to be CH4 < SiH4 < GeH4 <\nSnH4.\nA graph of the actual boiling points of these compounds versus the period of the group 14 element shows this\nprediction to be correct:\n10.1 • Intermolecular Forces\n479",

The ordering from lowest to\nhighest boiling point is therefore C2H6 < C3H8 < C4H10.\nThe shapes of molecules also affect the magnitudes of the dispersion forces between them. For example,\nboiling points for the isomers n-pentane, isopentane, and neopentane (shown in Figure 10.7) are 36 °C, 27 °C,\nand 9.5 °C, respectively. Even though these compounds are composed of molecules with the same chemical\nformula, C5H12, the difference in boiling points suggests that dispersion forces in the liquid phase are\ndifferent, being greatest for n-pentane and least for neopentane. The elongated shape of n-pentane provides a\ngreater surface area available for contact between molecules, resulting in correspondingly stronger dispersion\nforces. The more compact shape of isopentane offers a smaller surface area available for intermolecular\ncontact and, therefore, weaker dispersion forces. Neopentane molecules are the most compact of the three,\noffering the least available surface area for intermolecular contact and, hence, the weakest dispersion forces.\nThis behavior is analogous to the connections that may be formed between strips of VELCRO brand fasteners:\nthe greater the area of the strip’s contact, the stronger the connection.\n480\n10 • Liquids and Solids\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

They can quickly run up smooth walls and\nacross ceilings that have no toe-holds, and they do this without having suction cups or a sticky substance\non their toes. And while a gecko can lift its feet easily as it walks along a surface, if you attempt to pick it up,\nit sticks to the surface. How are geckos (as well as spiders and some other insects) able to do this? Although\nthis phenomenon has been investigated for hundreds of years, scientists only recently uncovered the\ndetails of the process that allows geckos’ feet to behave this way.\nGeckos’ toes are covered with hundreds of thousands of tiny hairs known as setae, with each seta, in turn,\nbranching into hundreds of tiny, flat, triangular tips called spatulae. The huge numbers of spatulae on its\nsetae provide a gecko, shown in Figure 10.8, with a large total surface area for sticking to a surface. In 2000,\nKellar Autumn, who leads a multi-institutional gecko research team, found that geckos adhered equally\nwell to both polar silicon dioxide and nonpolar gallium arsenide. This proved that geckos stick to surfaces\nbecause of dispersion forces—weak intermolecular attractions arising from temporary, synchronized\ncharge distributions between adjacent molecules. Although dispersion forces are very weak, the total\nattraction over millions of spatulae is large enough to support many times the gecko’s weight.\nIn 2014, two scientists developed a model to explain how geckos can rapidly transition from “sticky” to\n“non-sticky.” Alex Greaney and Congcong Hu at Oregon State University described how geckos can achieve\nthis by changing the angle between their spatulae and the surface. Geckos’ feet, which are normally\nnonsticky, become sticky when a small shear force is applied. By curling and uncurling their toes, geckos\ncan alternate between sticking and unsticking from a surface, and thus easily move across it. Later\nresearch led by Alyssa Stark at University of Akron showed that geckos can maintain their hold on\nhydrophobic surfaces (similar to the leaves in their habitats) equally well whether the surfaces were wet or\ndry. Stark's experiment used a ribbon to gently pull the geckos until they slipped, so that the researchers\ncould determine the geckos' ability to hold various surfaces under wet and dry conditions. Further\ninvestigations may eventually lead to the development of better adhesives and other applications.\n10.1 • Intermolecular Forces\n481",

Consider a polar molecule such as hydrogen chloride, HCl. In the HCl molecule, the\nmore electronegative Cl atom bears the partial negative charge, whereas the less electronegative H atom bears\nthe partial positive charge. An attractive force between HCl molecules results from the attraction between the\npositive end of one HCl molecule and the negative end of another. This attractive force is called a dipole-dipole\nattraction—the electrostatic force between the partially positive end of one polar molecule and the partially\nnegative end of another, as illustrated in Figure 10.9.\nFIGURE 10.9\nThis image shows two arrangements of polar molecules, such as HCl, that allow an attraction\nbetween the partial negative end of one molecule and the partial positive end of another.\nThe effect of a dipole-dipole attraction is apparent when we compare the properties of HCl molecules to\nnonpolar F2 molecules. Both HCl and F2 consist of the same number of atoms and have approximately the\nsame molecular mass. At a temperature of 150 K, molecules of both substances would have the same average\nKE. However, the dipole-dipole attractions between HCl molecules are sufficient to cause them to “stick\ntogether” to form a liquid, whereas the relatively weaker dispersion forces between nonpolar F2 molecules are\nnot, and so this substance is gaseous at this temperature. The higher normal boiling point of HCl (188 K)\ncompared to F2 (85 K) is a reflection of the greater strength of dipole-dipole attractions between HCl\nmolecules, compared to the attractions between nonpolar F2 molecules. We will often use values such as\nboiling or freezing points, or enthalpies of vaporization or fusion, as indicators of the relative strengths of IMFs\nof attraction present within different substances.\nFIGURE 10.8\nGeckos’ toes contain large numbers of tiny hairs (setae), which branch into many triangular tips\n(spatulae). Geckos adhere to surfaces because of van der Waals attractions between the surface and a gecko’s\nmillions of spatulae. By changing how the spatulae contact the surface, geckos can turn their stickiness “on” and\n“off.” (credit photo: modification of work by “JC*+A!”/Flickr)\n482\n10 • Liquids and Solids\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Explain your reasoning.\nSolution\nCO and N2 are both diatomic molecules with masses of about 28 amu, so they experience similar London\ndispersion forces. Because CO is a polar molecule, it experiences dipole-dipole attractions. Because N2 is\nnonpolar, its molecules cannot exhibit dipole-dipole attractions. The dipole-dipole attractions between CO\nmolecules are comparably stronger than the dispersion forces between nonpolar N2 molecules, so CO is\nexpected to have the higher boiling point.\nCheck Your Learning\nPredict which will have the higher boiling point: ICl or Br2. Explain your reasoning.\nAnswer:\nICl. ICl and Br2 have similar masses (~160 amu) and therefore experience similar London dispersion forces. ICl\nis polar and thus also exhibits dipole-dipole attractions; Br2 is nonpolar and does not. The relatively stronger\ndipole-dipole attractions require more energy to overcome, so ICl will have the higher boiling point.\nHydrogen Bonding\nNitrosyl fluoride (ONF, molecular mass 49 amu) is a gas at room temperature. Water (H2O, molecular mass 18\namu) is a liquid, even though it has a lower molecular mass. We clearly cannot attribute this difference\nbetween the two compounds to dispersion forces. Both molecules have about the same shape and ONF is the\nheavier and larger molecule. It is, therefore, expected to experience more significant dispersion forces.\nAdditionally, we cannot attribute this difference in boiling points to differences in the dipole moments of the\nmolecules. Both molecules are polar and exhibit comparable dipole moments. The large difference between\nthe boiling points is due to a particularly strong dipole-dipole attraction that may occur when a molecule\ncontains a hydrogen atom bonded to a fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen atom (the three most electronegative\nelements). The very large difference in electronegativity between the H atom (2.1) and the atom to which it is\nbonded (4.0 for an F atom, 3.5 for an O atom, or 3.0 for a N atom), combined with the very small size of a H\natom and the relatively small sizes of F, O, or N atoms, leads to highly concentrated partial charges with these\natoms. Molecules with F-H, O-H, or N-H moieties are very strongly attracted to similar moieties in nearby\nmolecules, a particularly strong type of dipole-dipole attraction called hydrogen bonding.

Decades later, Irving Langmuir and\nKatharine Blodgett built on Pockels' work in their own trough and important advances in surface chemistry.\nLangmuir pioneered methods for producing single-molecule layers of film; Blodgett applied these to the\ndevelopment of non-reflective glass (critical for film-making and other applications), and also studied methods\nrelated to cleaning surfaces, which are important in semiconductor fabrication.\nThe IMFs of attraction between two different molecules are called adhesive forces. Consider what happens\nwhen water comes into contact with some surface. If the adhesive forces between water molecules and the\nmolecules of the surface are weak compared to the cohesive forces between the water molecules, the water\ndoes not “wet” the surface. For example, water does not wet waxed surfaces or many plastics such as\npolyethylene. Water forms drops on these surfaces because the cohesive forces within the drops are greater\nthan the adhesive forces between the water and the plastic. Water spreads out on glass because the adhesive\nforce between water and glass is greater than the cohesive forces within the water. When water is confined in a\nglass tube, its meniscus (surface) has a concave shape because the water wets the glass and creeps up the side\nof the tube. On the other hand, the cohesive forces between mercury atoms are much greater than the adhesive\nforces between mercury and glass. Mercury therefore does not wet glass, and it forms a convex meniscus when\nconfined in a tube because the cohesive forces within the mercury tend to draw it into a drop (Figure 10.18).\nFIGURE 10.18\nDifferences in the relative strengths of cohesive and adhesive forces result in different meniscus\nshapes for mercury (left) and water (right) in glass tubes.

The adhesive forces between the liquid and the\nporous material, combined with the cohesive forces within the liquid, may be strong enough to move the liquid\nupward against gravity.\n490\n10 • Liquids and Solids\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Most cloth towels are made of cotton, and paper towels are generally made from paper pulp.\nBoth consist of long molecules of cellulose that contain many −OH groups. Water molecules are attracted to\nthese −OH groups and form hydrogen bonds with them, which draws the H2O molecules up the cellulose\nmolecules. The water molecules are also attracted to each other, so large amounts of water are drawn up the\ncellulose fibers.\nCapillary action can also occur when one end of a small diameter tube is immersed in a liquid, as illustrated in\nFigure 10.20. If the liquid molecules are strongly attracted to the tube molecules, the liquid creeps up the\ninside of the tube until the weight of the liquid and the adhesive forces are in balance. The smaller the\ndiameter of the tube is, the higher the liquid climbs.

This procedure can be easily done\nbecause of capillary action, the ability of a liquid to flow up a small tube against gravity, as shown in Figure\n10.21. When your finger is pricked, a drop of blood forms and holds together due to surface tension—the\nunbalanced intermolecular attractions at the surface of the drop. Then, when the open end of a narrow-\ndiameter glass tube touches the drop of blood, the adhesive forces between the molecules in the blood and\nthose at the glass surface draw the blood up the tube. How far the blood goes up the tube depends on the\ndiameter of the tube (and the type of fluid). A small tube has a relatively large surface area for a given\nvolume of blood, which results in larger (relative) attractive forces, allowing the blood to be drawn farther\nup the tube.

As one\nexample of global significance, consider the evaporation, condensation, freezing, and melting of water. These\nchanges of state are essential aspects of our earth’s water cycle as well as many other natural phenomena and\ntechnological processes of central importance to our lives. In this module, the essential aspects of phase\ntransitions are explored.\nVaporization and Condensation\nWhen a liquid vaporizes in a closed container, gas molecules cannot escape. As these gas phase molecules\nmove randomly about, they will occasionally collide with the surface of the condensed phase, and in some\ncases, these collisions will result in the molecules re-entering the condensed phase. The change from the gas\nphase to the liquid is called condensation. When the rate of condensation becomes equal to the rate of\nvaporization, neither the amount of the liquid nor the amount of the vapor in the container changes. The\nvapor in the container is then said to be in equilibrium with the liquid. Keep in mind that this is not a static\nsituation, as molecules are continually exchanged between the condensed and gaseous phases. Such is an\nexample of a dynamic equilibrium, the status of a system in which reciprocal processes (for example,\nvaporization and condensation) occur at equal rates. The pressure exerted by the vapor in equilibrium with a\nliquid in a closed container at a given temperature is called the liquid’s vapor pressure (or equilibrium vapor\npressure). The area of the surface of the liquid in contact with a vapor and the size of the vessel have no effect\non the vapor pressure, although they do affect the time required for the equilibrium to be reached. We can\nmeasure the vapor pressure of a liquid by placing a sample in a closed container, like that illustrated in Figure\n10.22, and using a manometer to measure the increase in pressure that is due to the vapor in equilibrium with\nthe condensed phase.\nFIGURE 10.22\nIn a closed container, dynamic equilibrium is reached when (a) the rate of molecules escaping from\nFIGURE 10.21\nBlood is collected for medical analysis by capillary action, which draws blood into a small\ndiameter glass tube.

Weak intermolecular attractions present less of a barrier to vaporization, and a reduced likelihood of\ngas recapture, yielding relatively high vapor pressures. The following example illustrates this dependence of\nvapor pressure on intermolecular attractive forces.\nEXAMPLE 10.5\nExplaining Vapor Pressure in Terms of IMFs\nGiven the shown structural formulas for these four compounds, explain their relative vapor pressures in terms\nof types and extents of IMFs:\nSolution\nDiethyl ether has a very small dipole and most of its intermolecular attractions are London forces. Although\nthis molecule is the largest of the four under consideration, its IMFs are the weakest and, as a result, its\nmolecules most readily escape from the liquid. It also has the highest vapor pressure. Due to its smaller size,\nethanol exhibits weaker dispersion forces than diethyl ether. However, ethanol is capable of hydrogen bonding\nand, therefore, exhibits stronger overall IMFs, which means that fewer molecules escape from the liquid at any\ngiven temperature, and so ethanol has a lower vapor pressure than diethyl ether. Water is much smaller than\neither of the previous substances and exhibits weaker dispersion forces, but its extensive hydrogen bonding\nprovides stronger intermolecular attractions, fewer molecules escaping the liquid, and a lower vapor pressure\nthan for either diethyl ether or ethanol. Ethylene glycol has two −OH groups, so, like water, it exhibits extensive\nhydrogen bonding. It is much larger than water and thus experiences larger London forces. Its overall IMFs are\nthe largest of these four substances, which means its vaporization rate will be the slowest and, consequently,\nits vapor pressure the lowest.\nCheck Your Learning\nAt 20 °C, the vapor pressures of several alcohols are given in this table.

As the size of molecule increases from methanol to butanol,\ndispersion forces increase, which means that the vapor pressures decrease as observed:\nPmethanol > Pethanol > Ppropanol > Pbutanol.\nAs temperature increases, the vapor pressure of a liquid also increases due to the increased average KE of its\nmolecules.

At room temperature and standard pressure, a piece of dry ice (solid CO2) sublimes, appearing to\ngradually disappear without ever forming any liquid. Snow and ice sublime at temperatures below the melting\npoint of water, a slow process that may be accelerated by winds and the reduced atmospheric pressures at high\naltitudes.

However, the same cylinder appears to contain no liquid on a hot summer day (35 °C).\nExplain these observations.\nSolution\nOn the cool day, the temperature of the CO2 is below the critical temperature of CO2, 304 K or 31 °C, so liquid\nCO2 is present in the cylinder. On the hot day, the temperature of the CO2 is greater than its critical\ntemperature of 31 °C.

The critical\ntemperature of oxygen is below room temperature; thus oxygen cannot be liquefied at room temperature.\nChemistry in Everyday Life\nDecaffeinating Coffee Using Supercritical CO2\nCoffee is the world’s second most widely traded commodity, following only petroleum. Across the globe,\npeople love coffee’s aroma and taste. Many of us also depend on one component of coffee—caffeine—to help\nus get going in the morning or stay alert in the afternoon. But late in the day, coffee’s stimulant effect can\nkeep you from sleeping, so you may choose to drink decaffeinated coffee in the evening.\nSince the early 1900s, many methods have been used to decaffeinate coffee. All have advantages and\ndisadvantages, and all depend on the physical and chemical properties of caffeine. Because caffeine is a\nsomewhat polar molecule, it dissolves well in water, a polar liquid. However, since many of the other\n400-plus compounds that contribute to coffee’s taste and aroma also dissolve in H2O, hot water\ndecaffeination processes can also remove some of these compounds, adversely affecting the smell and\ntaste of the decaffeinated coffee. Dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and ethyl acetate (CH3CO2C2H5) have similar\npolarity to caffeine, and are therefore very effective solvents for caffeine extraction, but both also remove\nsome flavor and aroma components, and their use requires long extraction and cleanup times. Because\nboth of these solvents are toxic, health concerns have been raised regarding the effect of residual solvent\nremaining in the decaffeinated coffee.\nSupercritical fluid extraction using carbon dioxide is now being widely used as a more effective and\nenvironmentally friendly decaffeination method (Figure 10.36). At temperatures above 304.2 K and\npressures above 7376 kPa, CO2 is a supercritical fluid, with properties of both gas and liquid. Like a gas, it\npenetrates deep into the coffee beans; like a liquid, it effectively dissolves certain substances. Supercritical\ncarbon dioxide extraction of steamed coffee beans removes 97−99% of the caffeine, leaving coffee’s flavor\nand aroma compounds intact. Because CO2 is a gas under standard conditions, its removal from the\nextracted coffee beans is easily accomplished, as is the recovery of the caffeine from the extract. The\ncaffeine recovered from coffee beans via this process is a valuable product that can be used subsequently\nas an additive to other foods or drugs.\n10.4 • Phase Diagrams\n509",

For\nexamples, candle waxes are amorphous solids composed of large hydrocarbon molecules. Some substances,\nsuch as silicon dioxide (shown in Figure 10.38), can form either crystalline or amorphous solids, depending on\nthe conditions under which it is produced. Also, amorphous solids may undergo a transition to the crystalline\nstate under appropriate conditions.\nFIGURE 10.38\n(a) Silicon dioxide, SiO2, is abundant in nature as one of several crystalline forms of the mineral\nquartz. (b) Rapid cooling of molten SiO2 yields an amorphous solid known as “fused silica”.\nCrystalline solids are generally classified according to the nature of the forces that hold its particles together.\nThese forces are primarily responsible for the physical properties exhibited by the bulk solids. The following\nsections provide descriptions of the major types of crystalline solids: ionic, metallic, covalent network, and\nmolecular.\nIonic Solids\nIonic solids, such as sodium chloride and nickel oxide, are composed of positive and negative ions that are\nheld together by electrostatic attractions, which can be quite strong (Figure 10.39). Many ionic crystals also\nhave high melting points. This is due to the very strong attractions between the ions—in ionic compounds, the\nattractions between full charges are (much) larger than those between the partial charges in polar molecular\ncompounds. This will be looked at in more detail in a later discussion of lattice energies. Although they are\nhard, they also tend to be brittle, and they shatter rather than bend. Ionic solids do not conduct electricity;\nhowever, they do conduct when molten or dissolved because their ions are free to move. Many simple\ncompounds formed by the reaction of a metallic element with a nonmetallic element are ionic.\nFIGURE 10.39\nSodium chloride is an ionic solid.\nMetallic Solids\nMetallic solids such as crystals of copper, aluminum, and iron are formed by metal atoms Figure 10.40. The\nstructure of metallic crystals is often described as a uniform distribution of atomic nuclei within a “sea” of\ndelocalized electrons. The atoms within such a metallic solid are held together by a unique force known as\nmetallic bonding that gives rise to many useful and varied bulk properties.

These differences reflect\ndifferences in strengths of metallic bonding among the metals.\nFIGURE 10.40\nCopper is a metallic solid.\nCovalent Network Solid\nCovalent network solids include crystals of diamond, silicon, some other nonmetals, and some covalent\ncompounds such as silicon dioxide (sand) and silicon carbide (carborundum, the abrasive on sandpaper).\nMany minerals have networks of covalent bonds. The atoms in these solids are held together by a network of\ncovalent bonds, as shown in Figure 10.41. To break or to melt a covalent network solid, covalent bonds must be\nbroken. Because covalent bonds are relatively strong, covalent network solids are typically characterized by\nhardness, strength, and high melting points. For example, diamond is one of the hardest substances known\nand melts above 3500 °C.\nFIGURE 10.41\nA covalent crystal contains a three-dimensional network of covalent bonds, as illustrated by the\nstructures of diamond, silicon dioxide, silicon carbide, and graphite.

Thus, the attractions between the\nunits that make up the crystal all have the same strength and all require the same amount of energy to be\nbroken. The gradual softening of an amorphous material differs dramatically from the distinct melting of a\ncrystalline solid. This results from the structural nonequivalence of the molecules in the amorphous solid.\nSome forces are weaker than others, and when an amorphous material is heated, the weakest intermolecular\nattractions break first.

In this module, we will explore\nsome of the details about the structures of metallic and ionic crystalline solids, and learn how these structures\nare determined experimentally.\nThe Structures of Metals\nWe will begin our discussion of crystalline solids by considering elemental metals, which are relatively simple\nbecause each contains only one type of atom. A pure metal is a crystalline solid with metal atoms packed\nclosely together in a repeating pattern. Some of the properties of metals in general, such as their malleability\nand ductility, are largely due to having identical atoms arranged in a regular pattern. The different properties\nof one metal compared to another partially depend on the sizes of their atoms and the specifics of their spatial\narrangements. We will explore the similarities and differences of four of the most common metal crystal\ngeometries in the sections that follow.\nUnit Cells of Metals\nThe structure of a crystalline solid, whether a metal or not, is best described by considering its simplest\nrepeating unit, which is referred to as its unit cell. The unit cell consists of lattice points that represent the\nlocations of atoms or ions. The entire structure then consists of this unit cell repeating in three dimensions, as\nillustrated in Figure 10.46.\n516\n10 • Liquids and Solids\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

To visualize this, imagine taking a large number of identical spheres, such as\ntennis balls, and arranging them uniformly in a container. The simplest way to do this would be to make layers\nin which the spheres in one layer are directly above those in the layer below, as illustrated in Figure 10.47. This\narrangement is called simple cubic structure, and the unit cell is called the simple cubic unit cell or\nprimitive cubic unit cell.\nFIGURE 10.47\nWhen metal atoms are arranged with spheres in one layer directly above or below spheres in\nanother layer, the lattice structure is called simple cubic. Note that the spheres are in contact.\nIn a simple cubic structure, the spheres are not packed as closely as they could be, and they only “fill” about\n52% of the volume of the container. This is a relatively inefficient arrangement, and only one metal (polonium,\nPo) crystallizes in a simple cubic structure. As shown in Figure 10.48, a solid with this type of arrangement\nconsists of planes (or layers) in which each atom contacts only the four nearest neighbors in its layer; one atom\ndirectly above it in the layer above; and one atom directly below it in the layer below. The number of other\nparticles that each particle in a crystalline solid contacts is known as its coordination number. For a\npolonium atom in a simple cubic array, the coordination number is, therefore, six.\nFIGURE 10.48\nAn atom in a simple cubic lattice structure contacts six other atoms, so it has a coordination\nnumber of six.\nIn a simple cubic lattice, the unit cell that repeats in all directions is a cube defined by the centers of eight\natoms, as shown in Figure 10.49. Atoms at adjacent corners of this unit cell contact each other, so the edge\nlength of this cell is equal to two atomic radii, or one atomic diameter. A cubic unit cell contains only the parts\nof these atoms that are within it. Since an atom at a corner of a simple cubic unit cell is contained by a total of\neight unit cells, only one-eighth of that atom is within a specific unit cell. And since each simple cubic unit cell\nhas one atom at each of its eight “corners,” there is\natom within one simple cubic unit cell.\n10.6 • Lattice Structures in Crystalline Solids\n517",

Diffraction is the change in the\ndirection of travel experienced by an electromagnetic wave when it encounters a physical barrier whose\ndimensions are comparable to those of the wavelength of the light. X-rays are electromagnetic radiation with\nwavelengths about as long as the distance between neighboring atoms in crystals (on the order of a few Å).\nWhen a beam of monochromatic X-rays strikes a crystal, its rays are scattered in all directions by the atoms\nwithin the crystal. When scattered waves traveling in the same direction encounter one another, they undergo\ninterference, a process by which the waves combine to yield either an increase or a decrease in amplitude\n(intensity) depending upon the extent to which the combining waves’ maxima are separated (see Figure\n10.63).\nFIGURE 10.63\nLight waves occupying the same space experience interference, combining to yield waves of greater\n(a) or lesser (b) intensity, depending upon the separation of their maxima and minima.\nWhen X-rays of a certain wavelength, λ, are scattered by atoms in adjacent crystal planes separated by a\ndistance, d, they may undergo constructive interference when the difference between the distances traveled by\nthe two waves prior to their combination is an integer factor, n, of the wavelength. This condition is satisfied\nwhen the angle of the diffracted beam, θ, is related to the wavelength and interatomic distance by the equation:\nThis relation is known as the Bragg equation in honor of W.

They were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine,\nalong with Maurice Wilkins, who provided experimental proof of DNA’s structure. British chemist Rosalind\nFranklin made invaluable contributions to this monumental achievement through her work in measuring\nX-ray diffraction images of DNA. Early in her career, Franklin’s research on the structure of coals proved\nhelpful to the British war effort. After shifting her focus to biological systems in the early 1950s, Franklin\nand doctoral student Raymond Gosling discovered that DNA consists of two forms: a long, thin fiber formed\nwhen wet (type “B”) and a short, wide fiber formed when dried (type “A”). Her X-ray diffraction images of\nDNA (Figure 10.66) provided the crucial information that allowed Watson and Crick to confirm that DNA\nforms a double helix, and to determine details of its size and structure. Franklin also conducted pioneering\nresearch on viruses and the RNA that contains their genetic information, uncovering new information that\nradically changed the body of knowledge in the field.

In a liquid, intermolecular\nattractive forces hold the molecules in contact,\nalthough they still have sufficient KE to move past\neach other.\nIntermolecular attractive forces, collectively referred\nto as van der Waals forces, are responsible for the\nbehavior of liquids and solids and are electrostatic in\nnature. Dipole-dipole attractions result from the\nelectrostatic attraction of the partial negative end of\none polar molecule for the partial positive end of\nanother. The temporary dipole that results from the\nmotion of the electrons in an atom can induce a\ndipole in an adjacent atom and give rise to the\nLondon dispersion force. London forces increase\nwith increasing molecular size. Hydrogen bonds are\na special type of dipole-dipole attraction that results\nwhen hydrogen is bonded to one of the three most\nelectronegative elements: F, O, or N.\n10.2 Properties of Liquids\nThe intermolecular forces between molecules in the\nliquid state vary depending upon their chemical\nidentities and result in corresponding variations in\nvarious physical properties. Cohesive forces\nbetween like molecules are responsible for a liquid’s\nviscosity (resistance to flow) and surface tension\n10 • Key Equations\n535",

Adhesive forces\nbetween the molecules of a liquid and different\nmolecules composing a surface in contact with the\nliquid are responsible for phenomena such as\nsurface wetting and capillary rise.\n10.3 Phase Transitions\nPhase transitions are processes that convert matter\nfrom one physical state into another. There are six\nphase transitions between the three phases of\nmatter. Melting, vaporization, and sublimation are\nall endothermic processes, requiring an input of\nheat to overcome intermolecular attractions. The\nreciprocal transitions of freezing, condensation, and\ndeposition are all exothermic processes, involving\nheat as intermolecular attractive forces are\nestablished or strengthened. The temperatures at\nwhich phase transitions occur are determined by the\nrelative strengths of intermolecular attractions and\nare, therefore, dependent on the chemical identity of\nthe substance.\n10.4 Phase Diagrams\nThe temperature and pressure conditions at which a\nsubstance exists in solid, liquid, and gaseous states\nare summarized in a phase diagram for that\nsubstance. Phase diagrams are combined plots of\nthree pressure-temperature equilibrium curves:\nsolid-liquid, liquid-gas, and solid-gas. These curves\nrepresent the relationships between phase-\ntransition temperatures and pressures. The point of\nintersection of all three curves represents the\nsubstance’s triple point—the temperature and\npressure at which all three phases are in\nequilibrium. At pressures below the triple point, a\nsubstance cannot exist in the liquid state, regardless\nof its temperature. The terminus of the liquid-gas\ncurve represents the substance’s critical point, the\npressure and temperature above which a liquid\nphase cannot exist.\n10.5 The Solid State of Matter\nSome substances form crystalline solids consisting\nof particles in a very organized structure; others\nform amorphous (noncrystalline) solids with an\ninternal structure that is not ordered. The main\ntypes of crystalline solids are ionic solids, metallic\nsolids, covalent network solids, and molecular\nsolids. The properties of the different kinds of\ncrystalline solids are due to the types of particles of\nwhich they consist, the arrangements of the\nparticles, and the strengths of the attractions\nbetween them. Because their particles experience\nidentical attractions, crystalline solids have distinct\nmelting temperatures; the particles in amorphous\nsolids experience a range of interactions, so they\nsoften gradually and melt over a range of\ntemperatures. Some crystalline solids have defects\nin the definite repeating pattern of their particles.\nThese defects (which include vacancies, atoms or\nions not in the regular positions, and impurities)\nchange physical properties such as electrical\nconductivity, which is exploited in the silicon\ncrystals used to manufacture computer chips.\n10.6 Lattice Structures in Crystalline Solids\nThe structures of crystalline metals and simple ionic\ncompounds can be described in terms of packing of\nspheres. Metal atoms can pack in hexagonal closest-\npacked structures, cubic closest-packed structures,\nbody-centered structures, and simple cubic\nstructures. The anions in simple ionic structures\ncommonly adopt one of these structures, and the\ncations occupy the spaces remaining between the\nanions. Small cations usually occupy tetrahedral\nholes in a closest-packed array of anions. Larger\ncations usually occupy octahedral holes. Still larger\ncations can occupy cubic holes in a simple cubic\narray of anions. The structure of a solid can be\ndescribed by indicating the size and shape of a unit\ncell and the contents of the cell. The type of\nstructure and dimensions of the unit cell can be\ndetermined by X-ray diffraction measurements.\nExercises\n10.1 Intermolecular Forces\n1.

They are being threatened by\nclimate change, oceanic acidification, and water pollution, all of which change the composition of the solution\nknown as seawater. Dissolved oxygen in seawater is critical for sea creatures, but as the oceans warm, oxygen\nbecomes less soluble. As the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, the concentration of\ncarbon dioxide in the oceans increases, contributing to oceanic acidification. Coral reefs are particularly\nsensitive to the acidification of the ocean, since the exoskeletons of the coral polyps are soluble in acidic\nsolutions. Humans contribute to the changing of seawater composition by allowing agricultural runoff and\nother forms of pollution to affect our oceans.\nSolutions are crucial to the processes that sustain life and to many other processes involving chemical\nreactions. This chapter considers the nature of solutions and examines factors that determine whether a\nsolution will form and what properties it may have. The properties of colloids—mixtures containing dispersed\nparticles larger than the molecules and ions of typical solutions—are also discussed.\nFigure 11.1\nCoral reefs, such as this one at the Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, are vital to the ecosystem of\nearth’s oceans. The health of coral reefs and all marine life depends on the specific chemical composition of the\ncomplex mixture known as seawater.

Often, one component of a solution is present at a significantly greater concentration, in which\ncase it is called the solvent. The other components of the solution present in relatively lesser concentrations\nare called solutes. Sugar is a covalent solid composed of sucrose molecules, C12H22O11. When this compound\ndissolves in water, its molecules become uniformly distributed among the molecules of water:\nThe subscript “aq” in the equation signifies that the sucrose molecules are solutes and are therefore\nindividually dispersed throughout the aqueous solution (water is the solvent). Although sucrose molecules are\nheavier than water molecules, they remain dispersed throughout the solution; gravity does not cause them to\n“settle out” over time.\nPotassium dichromate, K2Cr2O7, is an ionic compound composed of colorless potassium ions, K+, and orange\ndichromate ions,\nWhen a small amount of solid potassium dichromate is added to water, the\ncompound dissolves and dissociates to yield potassium ions and dichromate ions uniformly distributed\nthroughout the mixture (Figure 11.2), as indicated in this equation:\nAs with the mixture of sugar and water, this mixture is also an aqueous solution. Its solutes, potassium and\ndichromate ions, remain individually dispersed among the solvent (water) molecules.\nFIGURE 11.2\nWhen potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) is mixed with water, it forms a homogeneous orange solution.\n(credit: modification of work by Mark Ott)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit this virtual lab (http://openstax.org/l/16Phetsugar) to view simulations of the dissolution of common\ncovalent and ionic substances (sugar and salt) in water.\nWater is used so often as a solvent that the word solution has come to imply an aqueous solution to many\npeople. However, almost any gas, liquid, or solid can act as a solvent. Many alloys are solid solutions of one\nmetal dissolved in another; for example, US five-cent coins contain nickel dissolved in copper. Air is a gaseous\nsolution, a homogeneous mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and several other gases. Oxygen (a gas), alcohol (a\nliquid), and sugar (a solid) all dissolve in water (a liquid) to form liquid solutions. Table 11.1 gives examples of\nseveral different solutions and the phases of the solutes and solvents.\n548\n11 • Solutions and Colloids\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Sometimes a mixture is stirred to\nspeed up the dissolution process, but this is not necessary; a homogeneous solution will form eventually. The\ntopic of spontaneity is critically important to the study of chemical thermodynamics and is treated more\nthoroughly in a later chapter of this text. For purposes of this chapter’s discussion, it will suffice to consider\ntwo criteria that favor, but do not guarantee, the spontaneous formation of a solution:\n1.\na decrease in the internal energy of the system (an exothermic change, as discussed in the previous\nchapter on thermochemistry)\n2.\nan increased dispersal of matter in the system (which indicates an increase in the entropy of the system,\nas you will learn about in the later chapter on thermodynamics)\nIn the process of dissolution, an internal energy change often, but not always, occurs as heat is absorbed or\nevolved. An increase in matter dispersal always results when a solution forms from the uniform distribution of\nsolute molecules throughout a solvent.\nWhen the strengths of the intermolecular forces of attraction between solute and solvent species in a solution\nare no different than those present in the separated components, the solution is formed with no accompanying\nenergy change. Such a solution is called an ideal solution. A mixture of ideal gases (or gases such as helium\nand argon, which closely approach ideal behavior) is an example of an ideal solution, since the entities\ncomprising these gases experience no significant intermolecular attractions.\n1\nIf bubbles of gas are observed within the liquid, the mixture is not homogeneous and, thus, not a solution.\n11.1 • The Dissolution Process\n549",

          "text": "When containers of helium and argon are connected, the gases spontaneously mix due to diffusion and form a\nsolution (Figure 11.3). The formation of this solution clearly involves an increase in matter dispersal, since the\nhelium and argon atoms occupy a volume twice as large as that which each occupied before mixing.\nFIGURE 11.3\nSamples of helium and argon spontaneously mix to give a solution.\nIdeal solutions may also form when structurally similar liquids are mixed. For example, mixtures of the\nalcohols methanol (CH3OH) and ethanol (C2H5OH) form ideal solutions, as do mixtures of the hydrocarbons\npentane, C5H12, and hexane, C6H14. Placing methanol and ethanol, or pentane and hexane, in the bulbs shown\nin Figure 11.3 will result in the same diffusion and subsequent mixing of these liquids as is observed for the\nHe and Ar gases (although at a much slower rate), yielding solutions with no significant change in energy.\nUnlike a mixture of gases, however, the components of these liquid-liquid solutions do, indeed, experience\nintermolecular attractive forces. But since the molecules of the two substances being mixed are structurally\nvery similar, the intermolecular attractive forces between like and unlike molecules are essentially the same,\nand the dissolution process, therefore, does not entail any appreciable increase or decrease in energy. These\nexamples illustrate how increased matter dispersal alone can provide the driving force required to cause the\nspontaneous formation of a solution. In some cases, however, the relative magnitudes of intermolecular forces\nof attraction between solute and solvent species may prevent dissolution.\nThree types of intermolecular attractive forces are relevant to the dissolution process: solute-solute, solvent-\nsolvent, and solute-solvent. As illustrated in Figure 11.4, the formation of a solution may be viewed as a\nstepwise process in which energy is consumed to overcome solute-solute and solvent-solvent attractions\n(endothermic processes) and released when solute-solvent attractions are established (an exothermic process\nreferred to as solvation). The relative magnitudes of the energy changes associated with these stepwise\nprocesses determine whether the dissolution process overall will release or absorb energy. In some cases,\nsolutions do not form because the energy required to separate solute and solvent species is so much greater\nthan the energy released by solvation.\n550\n11 • Solutions and Colloids\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

          "text": "FIGURE 11.4\nThis schematic representation of dissolution shows a stepwise process involving the endothermic\nseparation of solute and solvent species (Steps 1 and 2) and exothermic solvation (Step 3).\nConsider the example of an ionic compound dissolving in water. Formation of the solution requires the\nelectrostatic forces between the cations and anions of the compound (solute–solute) be overcome completely\nas attractive forces are established between these ions and water molecules (solute–solvent). Hydrogen\nbonding between a relatively small fraction of the water molecules must also be overcome to accommodate\nany dissolved solute. If the solute’s electrostatic forces are significantly greater than the solvation forces, the\ndissolution process is significantly endothermic and the compound may not dissolve to an appreciable extent.\nCalcium carbonate, the major component of coral reefs, is one example of such an “insoluble” ionic compound\n(see Figure 11.1). On the other hand, if the solvation forces are much stronger than the compound’s\nelectrostatic forces, the dissolution is significantly exothermic and the compound may be highly soluble. A\ncommon example of this type of ionic compound is sodium chloride, commonly known as table salt.\nAs noted at the beginning of this module, spontaneous solution formation is favored, but not guaranteed, by\nexothermic dissolution processes. While many soluble compounds do, indeed, dissolve with the release of\nheat, some dissolve endothermically. Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) is one such example and is used to make\ninstant cold packs, like the one pictured in Figure 11.5, which are used for treating injuries. A thin-walled\nplastic bag of water is sealed inside a larger bag with solid NH4NO3. When the smaller bag is broken, a solution\nof NH4NO3 forms, absorbing heat from the surroundings (the injured area to which the pack is applied) and\nproviding a cold compress that decreases swelling. Endothermic dissolutions such as this one require a\ngreater energy input to separate the solute species than is recovered when the solutes are solvated, but they\nare spontaneous nonetheless due to the increase in disorder that accompanies formation of the solution.\n11.1 • The Dissolution Process\n551",

These substances constitute an important class of compounds called electrolytes. Substances\nthat do not yield ions when dissolved are called nonelectrolytes. If the physical or chemical process that\ngenerates the ions is essentially 100% efficient (all of the dissolved compound yields ions), then the substance\nis known as a strong electrolyte. If only a relatively small fraction of the dissolved substance undergoes the\nion-producing process, it is called a weak electrolyte.\nSubstances may be identified as strong, weak, or nonelectrolytes by measuring the electrical conductance of\nan aqueous solution containing the substance. To conduct electricity, a substance must contain freely mobile,\ncharged species. Most familiar is the conduction of electricity through metallic wires, in which case the mobile,\ncharged entities are electrons. Solutions may also conduct electricity if they contain dissolved ions, with\nconductivity increasing as ion concentration increases. Applying a voltage to electrodes immersed in a\nsolution permits assessment of the relative concentration of dissolved ions, either quantitatively, by measuring\nthe electrical current flow, or qualitatively, by observing the brightness of a light bulb included in the circuit\n552\n11 • Solutions and Colloids\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Water molecules in front of and behind the ions are not shown.\nWhen ionic compounds dissolve in water, the ions in the solid separate and disperse uniformly throughout the\nsolution because water molecules surround and solvate the ions, reducing the strong electrostatic forces\nbetween them. This process represents a physical change known as dissociation. Under most conditions, ionic\ncompounds will dissociate nearly completely when dissolved, and so they are classified as strong electrolytes.\nEven sparingly, soluble ionic compounds are strong electrolytes, since the small amount that does dissolve will\ndissociate completely.\nConsider what happens at the microscopic level when solid KCl is added to water. Ion-dipole forces attract the\npositive (hydrogen) end of the polar water molecules to the negative chloride ions at the surface of the solid,\nand they attract the negative (oxygen) ends to the positive potassium ions. The water molecules surround\nindividual K+ and Cl−ions, reducing the strong interionic forces that bind the ions together and letting them\nmove off into solution as solvated ions, as Figure 11.7 shows. Overcoming the electrostatic attraction permits\nthe independent motion of each hydrated ion in a dilute solution as the ions transition from fixed positions in\nthe undissolved compound to widely dispersed, solvated ions in solution.\nCovalent Electrolytes\nPure water is an extremely poor conductor of electricity because it is only very slightly ionized—only about two\nout of every 1 billion molecules ionize at 25 °C. Water ionizes when one molecule of water gives up a proton (H+\nion) to another molecule of water, yielding hydronium and hydroxide ions.\nIn some cases, solutions prepared from covalent compounds conduct electricity because the solute molecules\nreact chemically with the solvent to produce ions. For example, pure hydrogen chloride is a gas consisting of\ncovalent HCl molecules. This gas contains no ions. However, an aqueous solution of HCl is a very good\nconductor, indicating that an appreciable concentration of ions exists within the solution.\nBecause HCl is an acid, its molecules react with water, transferring H+ ions to form hydronium ions (H3O+) and\n554\n11 • Solutions and Colloids\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

You can repeat this process until the sugar concentration of the solution reaches its natural\nlimit, a limit determined primarily by the relative strengths of the solute-solute, solute-solvent, and solvent-\nsolvent attractive forces discussed in the previous two modules of this chapter. You can be certain that you\nhave reached this limit because, no matter how long you stir the solution, undissolved sugar remains. The\nconcentration of sugar in the solution at this point is known as its solubility.\nThe solubility of a solute in a particular solvent is the maximum concentration that may be achieved under\ngiven conditions when the dissolution process is at equilibrium.\nWhen a solute’s concentration is equal to its solubility, the solution is said to be saturated with that solute. If\nthe solute’s concentration is less than its solubility, the solution is said to be unsaturated. A solution that\ncontains a relatively low concentration of solute is called dilute, and one with a relatively high concentration is\ncalled concentrated.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nUse this interactive simulation (http://openstax.org/l/16Phetsoluble) to prepare various saturated solutions.\nSolutions may be prepared in which a solute concentration exceeds its solubility. Such solutions are said to be\nsupersaturated, and they are interesting examples of nonequilibrium states (a detailed treatment of this\nimportant concept is provided in the text chapters on equilibrium). For example, the carbonated beverage in\nan open container that has not yet “gone flat” is supersaturated with carbon dioxide gas; given time, the CO2\nconcentration will decrease until it reaches its solubility.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this impressive video (http://openstax.org/l/16NaAcetate) showing the precipitation of sodium acetate\nfrom a supersaturated solution.\nSolutions of Gases in Liquids\nAs for any solution, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is affected by the intermolecular attractive forces between\nsolute and solvent species. Unlike solid and liquid solutes, however, there is no solute-solute intermolecular\nattraction to overcome when a gaseous solute dissolves in a liquid solvent (see Figure 11.4) since the atoms or\nmolecules comprising a gas are far separated and experience negligible interactions. Consequently, solute-\nsolvent interactions are the sole energetic factor affecting solubility. For example, the water solubility of\n11.3 • Solubility\n555",

Thus, for example, the solubility of ammonia in water increases more rapidly with increasing\npressure than predicted by the law because ammonia, being a base, reacts to some extent with water to form\nammonium ions and hydroxide ions.\nGases can form supersaturated solutions. If a solution of a gas in a liquid is prepared either at low temperature\nor under pressure (or both), then as the solution warms or as the gas pressure is reduced, the solution may\nbecome supersaturated.

In addition to the pressure exerted by\nthe atmosphere, divers are subjected to additional pressure due to the water above them, experiencing an\nincrease of approximately 1 atm for each 10 m of depth. Therefore, the air inhaled by a diver while\nsubmerged contains gases at the corresponding higher ambient pressure, and the concentrations of the\ngases dissolved in the diver’s blood are proportionally higher per Henry’s law.\nAs the diver ascends to the surface of the water, the ambient pressure decreases and the dissolved gases\nbecomes less soluble. If the ascent is too rapid, the gases escaping from the diver’s blood may form bubbles\nthat can cause a variety of symptoms ranging from rashes and joint pain to paralysis and death. To avoid\nDCS, divers must ascend from depths at relatively slow speeds (10 or 20 m/min) or otherwise make several\ndecompression stops, pausing for several minutes at given depths during the ascent. When these\npreventive measures are unsuccessful, divers with DCS are often provided hyperbaric oxygen therapy in\npressurized vessels called decompression (or recompression) chambers (Figure 11.11). Researchers are\nalso investigating related body reactions and defenses in order to develop better testing and treatment for\ndecompression sicknetss. For example, Ingrid Eftedal, a barophysiologist specializing in bodily reactions\nto diving, has shown that white blood cells undergo chemical and genetic changes as a result of the\ncondition; these can potentially be used to create biomarker tests and other methods to manage\ndecompression sickness.\nFIGURE 11.11\n(a) US Navy divers undergo training in a recompression chamber.

For such liquids, the dipole-dipole attractions (or hydrogen bonding) of the\nsolute molecules with the solvent molecules are at least as strong as those between molecules in the pure\nsolute or in the pure solvent. Hence, the two kinds of molecules mix easily. Likewise, nonpolar liquids are\nmiscible with each other because there is no appreciable difference in the strengths of solute-solute, solvent-\nsolvent, and solute-solvent intermolecular attractions. The solubility of polar molecules in polar solvents and\nof nonpolar molecules in nonpolar solvents is, again, an illustration of the chemical axiom “like dissolves like.”\nTwo liquids that do not mix to an appreciable extent are called immiscible.

This\nphenomenon can be rationalized by considering the effect of added solute molecules on the liquid's\nvaporization and condensation processes.

The group 2 metal salts are frequently mixed with the\ncheaper and more readily available sodium chloride (“rock salt”) for use on roads, since they tend to be\nsomewhat less corrosive than the NaCl, and they provide a larger depression of the freezing point, since\nthey dissociate to yield three particles per formula unit, rather than two particles like the sodium chloride.\nBecause these ionic compounds tend to hasten the corrosion of metal, they would not be a wise choice to\nuse in antifreeze for the radiator in your car or to de-ice a plane prior to takeoff. For these applications,\ncovalent compounds, such as ethylene or propylene glycol, are often used. The glycols used in radiator\nfluid not only lower the freezing point of the liquid, but they elevate the boiling point, making the fluid\nuseful in both winter and summer.

The solid and\ngaseous phases, therefore, are composed of solvent only, and so transitions between these phases are not\nsubject to colligative effects.\nOsmosis and Osmotic Pressure of Solutions\nA number of natural and synthetic materials exhibit selective permeation, meaning that only molecules or ions\nof a certain size, shape, polarity, charge, and so forth, are capable of passing through (permeating) the\nmaterial. Biological cell membranes provide elegant examples of selective permeation in nature, while dialysis\ntubing used to remove metabolic wastes from blood is a more simplistic technological example. Regardless of\nhow they may be fabricated, these materials are generally referred to as semipermeable membranes.\nConsider the apparatus illustrated in Figure 11.24, in which samples of pure solvent and a solution are\nseparated by a membrane that only solvent molecules may permeate. Solvent molecules will diffuse across the\nmembrane in both directions. Since the concentration of solvent is greater in the pure solvent than the\nsolution, these molecules will diffuse from the solvent side of the membrane to the solution side at a faster rate\nthan they will in the reverse direction. The result is a net transfer of solvent molecules from the pure solvent to\nthe solution. Diffusion-driven transfer of solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane is a process\nknown as osmosis.\nFIGURE 11.24\n(a) A solution and pure solvent are initially separated by an osmotic membrane. (b) Net transfer of\nsolvent molecules to the solution occurs until its osmotic pressure yields equal rates of transfer in both directions.\nWhen osmosis is carried out in an apparatus like that shown in Figure 11.24, the volume of the solution\nincreases as it becomes diluted by accumulation of solvent. This causes the level of the solution to rise,\nincreasing its hydrostatic pressure (due to the weight of the column of solution in the tube) and resulting in a\nfaster transfer of solvent molecules back to the pure solvent side. When the pressure reaches a value that\nyields a reverse solvent transfer rate equal to the osmosis rate, bulk transfer of solvent ceases. This pressure is\ncalled the osmotic pressure (Π) of the solution. The osmotic pressure of a dilute solution is related to its\nsolute molarity, M, and absolute temperature, T, according to the equation\nwhere R is the universal gas constant.\n576\n11 • Solutions and Colloids\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Carrots and celery that have become limp because they have lost water can be made crisp again\nby placing them in water. Water moves into the carrot or celery cells by osmosis. A cucumber placed in a\nconcentrated salt solution loses water by osmosis and absorbs some salt to become a pickle. Osmosis can also\naffect animal cells. Solute concentrations are particularly important when solutions are injected into the body.\nSolutes in body cell fluids and blood serum give these solutions an osmotic pressure of approximately 7.7 atm.\nSolutions injected into the body must have the same osmotic pressure as blood serum; that is, they should be\nisotonic with blood serum. If a less concentrated solution, a hypotonic solution, is injected in sufficient\nquantity to dilute the blood serum, water from the diluted serum passes into the blood cells by osmosis,\ncausing the cells to expand and rupture. This process is called hemolysis. When a more concentrated solution,\na hypertonic solution, is injected, the cells lose water to the more concentrated solution, shrivel, and possibly\ndie in a process called crenation. These effects are illustrated in Figure 11.27.\nChemistry in Everyday Life\nReverse Osmosis Water Purification\nIn the process of osmosis, diffusion serves to move water through a semipermeable membrane from a less\nconcentrated solution to a more concentrated solution. Osmotic pressure is the amount of pressure that\nmust be applied to the more concentrated solution to cause osmosis to stop. If greater pressure is applied,\nthe water will go from the more concentrated solution to a less concentrated (more pure) solution. This is\ncalled reverse osmosis. Reverse osmosis (RO) is used to purify water in many applications, from\ndesalination plants in coastal cities, to water-purifying machines in grocery stores (Figure 11.26), and\nsmaller reverse-osmosis household units. With a hand-operated pump, small RO units can be used in\nthird-world countries, disaster areas, and in lifeboats.

Similar discrepancies are observed for other ionic compounds, and the differences between the\nmeasured and expected colligative property values typically become more significant as solute concentrations\nincrease. These observations suggest that the ions of sodium chloride (and other strong electrolytes) are not\ncompletely dissociated in solution.\nTo account for this and avoid the errors accompanying the assumption of total dissociation, an experimentally\nmeasured parameter named in honor of Nobel Prize-winning German chemist Jacobus Henricus van’t Hoff is\nused. The van’t Hoff factor (i) is defined as the ratio of solute particles in solution to the number of formula\nunits dissolved:\nValues for measured van’t Hoff factors for several solutes, along with predicted values assuming complete\ndissociation, are shown in Table 11.3.\nPredicated and Measured van’t Hoff Factors for Several 0.050 m Aqueous Solutions\nFormula unit\nClassification\nDissolution products\ni (predicted)\ni (measured)\nC12H22O11 (glucose)\nNonelectrolyte\nC12H22O11\n1\n1.0\nNaCl\nStrong electrolyte\nNa+, Cl−\n2\n1.9\nHCl\nStrong electrolyte (acid)\nH3O+, Cl−\n2\n1.9\nMgSO4\nStrong electrolyte\nMg2+, SO42−,\n2\n1.3\nTABLE 11.3\n11.4 • Colligative Properties\n581",

They suggested that although interionic attraction in an aqueous solution is\nvery greatly reduced by solvation of the ions and the insulating action of the polar solvent, it is not completely\nnullified. The residual attractions prevent the ions from behaving as totally independent particles (Figure\n11.28). In some cases, a positive and negative ion may actually touch, giving a solvated unit called an ion pair.\nThus, the activity, or the effective concentration, of any particular kind of ion is less than that indicated by the\nactual concentration. Ions become more and more widely separated the more dilute the solution, and the\nresidual interionic attractions become less and less. Thus, in extremely dilute solutions, the effective\nconcentrations of the ions (their activities) are essentially equal to the actual concentrations.

The particulate component typically present in a\nrelatively minor amount is called the dispersed phase and the substance or solution throughout which the\nparticulate is dispersed is called the dispersion medium. Colloids may involve virtually any combination of\nphysical states (gas in liquid, liquid in solid, solid in gas, etc.), as illustrated by the examples of colloidal\nsystems given in Table 11.4.\nExamples of Colloidal Systems\nDispersed Phase\nDispersion Medium\nCommon Examples\nName\nsolid\ngas\nsmoke, dust\n—\nsolid\nliquid\nstarch in water, some inks, paints, milk of magnesia\nsol\nsolid\nsolid\nsome colored gems, some alloys\n—\nliquid\ngas\nclouds, fogs, mists, sprays\naerosol\nliquid\nliquid\nmilk, mayonnaise, butter\nemulsion\nliquid\nsolid\njellies, gels, pearl, opal (H2O in SiO2)\ngel\nTABLE 11.4\n11.5 • Colloids\n585",

Particles of colloidal size are formed by two methods:\n1.\nDispersion methods: breaking down larger particles. For example, paint pigments are produced by\ndispersing large particles by grinding in special mills.\n2.\nCondensation methods: growth from smaller units, such as molecules or ions. For example, clouds form\nwhen water molecules condense and form very small droplets.\nA few solid substances, when brought into contact with water, disperse spontaneously and form colloidal\nsystems. Gelatin, glue, starch, and dehydrated milk powder behave in this manner. The particles are already of\ncolloidal size; the water simply disperses them. Powdered milk particles of colloidal size are produced by\ndehydrating milk spray. Some atomizers produce colloidal dispersions of a liquid in air.\nAn emulsion may be prepared by shaking together or blending two immiscible liquids. This breaks one liquid\ninto droplets of colloidal size, which then disperse throughout the other liquid. Oil spills in the ocean may be\ndifficult to clean up, partly because wave action can cause the oil and water to form an emulsion. In many\nemulsions, however, the dispersed phase tends to coalesce, form large drops, and separate. Therefore,\nemulsions are usually stabilized by an emulsifying agent, a substance that inhibits the coalescence of the\ndispersed liquid. For example, a little soap will stabilize an emulsion of kerosene in water. Milk is an emulsion\nof butterfat in water, with the protein casein serving as the emulsifying agent. Mayonnaise is an emulsion of oil\nin vinegar, with egg yolk components as the emulsifying agents.\nCondensation methods form colloidal particles by aggregation of molecules or ions. If the particles grow\nbeyond the colloidal size range, drops or precipitates form, and no colloidal system results. Clouds form when\nwater molecules aggregate and form colloid-sized particles. If these water particles coalesce to form\nadequately large water drops of liquid water or crystals of solid water, they settle from the sky as rain, sleet, or\nsnow. Many condensation methods involve chemical reactions. A red colloidal suspension of iron(III)\nhydroxide may be prepared by mixing a concentrated solution of iron(III) chloride with hot water:\nA colloidal gold sol results from the reduction of a very dilute solution of gold(III) chloride by a reducing agent\nsuch as formaldehyde, tin(II) chloride, or iron(II) sulfate:\nSome gold sols prepared in 1857 are still intact (the particles have not coalesced and settled), illustrating the\nlong-term stability of many colloids.\nSoaps and Detergents\nPioneers made soap by boiling fats with a strongly basic solution made by leaching potassium carbonate,\nK2CO3, from wood ashes with hot water. Animal fats contain polyesters of fatty acids (long-chain carboxylic\nacids). When animal fats are treated with a base like potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide, glycerol and\nsalts of fatty acids such as palmitic, oleic, and stearic acid are formed. The salts of fatty acids are called soaps.\nThe sodium salt of stearic acid, sodium stearate, has the formula C17H35CO2Na and contains an uncharged\nnonpolar hydrocarbon chain, the C17H35— unit, and an ionic carboxylate group, the —\nunit (Figure\n11.31).\n586\n11 • Solutions and Colloids\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

The hydrocarbon (nonpolar) end of a soap or detergent molecule dissolves in, or is attracted to,\nnonpolar substances such as oil, grease, or dirt particles. The ionic end is attracted by water (polar), illustrated\nin Figure 11.33. As a result, the soap or detergent molecules become oriented at the interface between the dirt\nparticles and the water so they act as a kind of bridge between two different kinds of matter, nonpolar and\npolar. Molecules such as this are termed amphiphilic since they have both a hydrophobic (“water-fearing”)\npart and a hydrophilic (“water-loving”) part. As a consequence, dirt particles become suspended as colloidal\nparticles and are readily washed away.\nFIGURE 11.33\nThis diagrammatic cross section of an emulsified drop of oil in water shows how soap or detergent\nacts as an emulsifier.\nChemistry in Everyday Life\nDeepwater Horizon Oil Spill\nThe blowout of the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig on April 20, 2010, in the Gulf of Mexico near\nMississippi began the largest marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry. In the 87 days\nfollowing the blowout, an estimated 4.9 million barrels (210 million gallons) of oil flowed from the ruptured\nwell 5000 feet below the water’s surface. The well was finally declared sealed on September 19, 2010.\nCrude oil is immiscible with and less dense than water, so the spilled oil rose to the surface of the water.\n11.5 • Colloids\n587",

          "text": "Electrical Properties of Colloidal Particles\nDispersed colloidal particles are often electrically charged. A colloidal particle of iron(III) hydroxide, for\nexample, does not contain enough hydroxide ions to compensate exactly for the positive charges on the\niron(III) ions. Thus, each individual colloidal particle bears a positive charge, and the colloidal dispersion\nconsists of charged colloidal particles and some free hydroxide ions, which keep the dispersion electrically\nneutral. Most metal hydroxide colloids have positive charges, whereas most metals and metal sulfides form\nnegatively charged dispersions. All colloidal particles in any one system have charges of the same sign. This\nhelps keep them dispersed because particles containing like charges repel each other.\nThe charged nature of some colloidal particles may be exploited to remove them from a variety of mixtures.\nFor example, the particles comprising smoke are often colloidally dispersed and electrically charged.\nFrederick Cottrell, an American chemist, developed a process to remove these particles. The charged particles\nare attracted to highly charged electrodes, where they are neutralized and deposited as dust (Figure 11.36).\nThis is one of the important methods used to clean up the smoke from a variety of industrial processes. The\nprocess is also important in the recovery of valuable products from the smoke and flue dust of smelters,\nfurnaces, and kilns. There are also similar electrostatic air filters designed for home use to improve indoor air\nquality.\nFloating booms, skimmer ships, and controlled burns were used to remove oil from the water’s surface in\nan attempt to protect beaches and wetlands along the Gulf coast. In addition to removal of the oil, attempts\nwere also made to lessen its environmental impact by rendering it “soluble” (in the loose sense of the term)\nand thus allowing it to be diluted to hopefully less harmful levels by the vast volume of ocean water. This\napproach used 1.84 million gallons of the oil dispersant Corexit 9527, most of which was injected\nunderwater at the site of the leak, with small amounts being sprayed on top of the spill. Corexit 9527\ncontains 2-butoxyethanol (C6H14O2), an amphiphilic molecule whose polar and nonpolar ends are useful\nfor emulsifying oil into small droplets, increasing the surface area of the oil and making it more available to\nmarine bacteria for digestion (Figure 11.34). While this approach avoids many of the immediate hazards\nthat bulk oil poses to marine and coastal ecosystems, it introduces the possibility of long-term effects\nresulting from the introduction of the complex and potential toxic components of petroleum into the\nocean’s food chain. A number of organizations are involved in monitoring the extended impact of this oil\nspill, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (visit this website\n(http://openstax.org/l/16gulfspill) for additional details).\nFIGURE 11.34\n(a) This NASA satellite image shows the oil slick from the Deepwater Horizon spill.

The solvent is\nthe most concentrated component and determines\nthe physical state of the solution. The solutes are the\nother components typically present at\nconcentrations less than that of the solvent.\nSolutions may form endothermically or\nexothermically, depending upon the relative\nmagnitudes of solute and solvent intermolecular\nattractive forces. Ideal solutions form with no\nappreciable change in energy.\n11.2 Electrolytes\nSubstances that dissolve in water to yield ions are\ncalled electrolytes. Electrolytes may be covalent\ncompounds that chemically react with water to\nproduce ions (for example, acids and bases), or they\nmay be ionic compounds that dissociate to yield\ntheir constituent cations and anions, when\ndissolved. Dissolution of an ionic compound is\nfacilitated by ion-dipole attractions between the ions\nof the compound and the polar water molecules.\nSoluble ionic substances and strong acids ionize\ncompletely and are strong electrolytes, while weak\nacids and bases ionize to only a small extent and are\nweak electrolytes. Nonelectrolytes are substances\nthat do not produce ions when dissolved in water.\n11.3 Solubility\nThe extent to which one substance will dissolve in\nanother is determined by several factors, including\nthe types and relative strengths of intermolecular\nattractive forces that may exist between the\nsubstances’ atoms, ions, or molecules. This\ntendency to dissolve is quantified as a substance’s\nsolubility, its maximum concentration in a solution\nat equilibrium under specified conditions. A\nsaturated solution contains solute at a concentration\nequal to its solubility. A supersaturated solution is\none in which a solute’s concentration exceeds its\nsolubility—a nonequilibrium (unstable) condition\nthat will result in solute precipitation when the\nsolution is appropriately perturbed. Miscible liquids\nare soluble in all proportions, and immiscible\nliquids exhibit very low mutual solubility.\nSolubilities for gaseous solutes decrease with\nincreasing temperature, while those for most, but\nnot all, solid solutes increase with temperature. The\nconcentration of a gaseous solute in a solution is\nproportional to the partial pressure of the gas to\nwhich the solution is exposed, a relation known as\nHenry’s law.\n11.4 Colligative Properties\nProperties of a solution that depend only on the\nconcentration of solute particles are called\ncolligative properties. They include changes in the\nvapor pressure, boiling point, and freezing point of\nthe solvent in the solution. The magnitudes of these\nproperties depend only on the total concentration of\nsolute particles in solution, not on the type of\nparticles. The total concentration of solute particles\nin a solution also determines its osmotic pressure.\nThis is the pressure that must be applied to the\nsolution to prevent diffusion of molecules of pure\nsolvent through a semipermeable membrane into\nthe solution. Ionic compounds may not completely\ndissociate in solution due to activity effects, in which\ncase observed colligative effects may be less than\npredicted.\n11.5 Colloids\nColloids are mixtures in which one or more\nsubstances are dispersed as relatively large solid\nparticles or liquid droplets throughout a solid,\nliquid, or gaseous medium.

Speed is a familiar rate that expresses the distance\ntraveled by an object in a given amount of time. Wage is a rate that represents the amount of money earned by\na person working for a given amount of time. Likewise, the rate of a chemical reaction is a measure of how\nmuch reactant is consumed, or how much product is produced, by the reaction in a given amount of time.\nThe rate of reaction is the change in the amount of a reactant or product per unit time. Reaction rates are\ntherefore determined by measuring the time dependence of some property that can be related to reactant or\nproduct amounts. Rates of reactions that consume or produce gaseous substances, for example, are\nconveniently determined by measuring changes in volume or pressure. For reactions involving one or more\ncolored substances, rates may be monitored via measurements of light absorption. For reactions involving\naqueous electrolytes, rates may be measured via changes in a solution’s conductivity.\nFor reactants and products in solution, their relative amounts (concentrations) are conveniently used for\npurposes of expressing reaction rates. For example, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, in an\naqueous solution changes slowly over time as it decomposes according to the equation:\nThe rate at which the hydrogen peroxide decomposes can be expressed in terms of the rate of change of its\nconcentration, as shown here:\nThis mathematical representation of the change in species concentration over time is the rate expression for\nthe reaction. The brackets indicate molar concentrations, and the symbol delta (Δ) indicates “change in.” Thus,\nrepresents the molar concentration of hydrogen peroxide at some time t1; likewise,\nrepresents the molar concentration of hydrogen peroxide at a later time t2; and Δ[H2O2] represents the change\nin molar concentration of hydrogen peroxide during the time interval Δt (that is, t2 −t1). Since the reactant\nconcentration decreases as the reaction proceeds, Δ[H2O2] is a negative quantity. Reaction rates are, by\nconvention, positive quantities, and so this negative change in concentration is multiplied by −1. Figure 12.2\nprovides an example of data collected during the decomposition of H2O2.\n600\n12 • Kinetics\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

          "text": "FIGURE 12.2\nThe rate of decomposition of H2O2 in an aqueous solution decreases as the concentration of H2O2\ndecreases.\nTo obtain the tabulated results for this decomposition, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide was measured\nevery 6 hours over the course of a day at a constant temperature of 40 °C. Reaction rates were computed for\neach time interval by dividing the change in concentration by the corresponding time increment, as shown\nhere for the first 6-hour period:\nNotice that the reaction rates vary with time, decreasing as the reaction proceeds. Results for the last 6-hour\nperiod yield a reaction rate of:\nThis behavior indicates the reaction continually slows with time. Using the concentrations at the beginning\nand end of a time period over which the reaction rate is changing results in the calculation of an average rate\nfor the reaction over this time interval. At any specific time, the rate at which a reaction is proceeding is known\nas its instantaneous rate. The instantaneous rate of a reaction at “time zero,” when the reaction commences,\nis its initial rate. Consider the analogy of a car slowing down as it approaches a stop sign. The vehicle’s initial\nrate—analogous to the beginning of a chemical reaction—would be the speedometer reading at the moment the\ndriver begins pressing the brakes (t0). A few moments later, the instantaneous rate at a specific moment—call it\nt1—would be somewhat slower, as indicated by the speedometer reading at that point in time. As time passes,\nthe instantaneous rate will continue to fall until it reaches zero, when the car (or reaction) stops. Unlike\ninstantaneous speed, the car’s average speed is not indicated by the speedometer; but it can be calculated as\nthe ratio of the distance traveled to the time required to bring the vehicle to a complete stop (Δt). Like the\ndecelerating car, the average rate of a chemical reaction will fall somewhere between its initial and final rates.\nThe instantaneous rate of a reaction may be determined one of two ways. If experimental conditions permit\nthe measurement of concentration changes over very short time intervals, then average rates computed as\ndescribed earlier provide reasonably good approximations of instantaneous rates. Alternatively, a graphical\nprocedure may be used that, in effect, yields the results that would be obtained if short time interval\nmeasurements were possible. In a plot of the concentration of hydrogen peroxide against time, the\ninstantaneous rate of decomposition of H2O2 at any time t is given by the slope of a straight line that is tangent\nto the curve at that time (Figure 12.3). These tangent line slopes may be evaluated using calculus, but the\nprocedure for doing so is beyond the scope of this chapter.\n12.1 • Chemical Reaction Rates\n601",

Tangents are shown at t = 0 h\n(“initial rate”) and at t = 12 h (“instantaneous rate” at 12 h).\nChemistry in Everyday Life\nReaction Rates in Analysis: Test Strips for Urinalysis\nPhysicians often use disposable test strips to measure the amounts of various substances in a patient’s\nurine (Figure 12.4). These test strips contain various chemical reagents, embedded in small pads at various\nlocations along the strip, which undergo changes in color upon exposure to sufficient concentrations of\nspecific substances. The usage instructions for test strips often stress that proper read time is critical for\noptimal results. This emphasis on read time suggests that kinetic aspects of the chemical reactions\noccurring on the test strip are important considerations.\nThe test for urinary glucose relies on a two-step process represented by the chemical equations shown\nhere:\nThe first equation depicts the oxidation of glucose in the urine to yield glucolactone and hydrogen\nperoxide. The hydrogen peroxide produced subsequently oxidizes colorless iodide ion to yield brown\niodine, which may be visually detected. Some strips include an additional substance that reacts with iodine\nto produce a more distinct color change.\nThe two test reactions shown above are inherently very slow, but their rates are increased by special\nenzymes embedded in the test strip pad. This is an example of catalysis, a topic discussed later in this\nchapter. A typical glucose test strip for use with urine requires approximately 30 seconds for completion of\nthe color-forming reactions. Reading the result too soon might lead one to conclude that the glucose\nconcentration of the urine sample is lower than it actually is (a false-negative result). Waiting too long to\nassess the color change can lead to a false positive due to the slower (not catalyzed) oxidation of iodide ion\nby other substances found in urine.\n602\n12 • Kinetics\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Reactions that appear similar\nmay have different rates under the same conditions, depending on the identity of the reactants. For example,\nwhen small pieces of the metals iron and sodium are exposed to air, the sodium reacts completely with air\n12.2 • Factors Affecting Reaction Rates\n605",

Yet calcium reacts at a moderate rate, whereas sodium reacts so rapidly that the\nreaction is almost explosive.\nThe Physical States of the Reactants\nA chemical reaction between two or more substances requires intimate contact between the reactants. When\nreactants are in different physical states, or phases (solid, liquid, gaseous, dissolved), the reaction takes place\nonly at the interface between the phases. Consider the heterogeneous reaction between a solid phase and\neither a liquid or gaseous phase. Compared with the reaction rate for large solid particles, the rate for smaller\nparticles will be greater because the surface area in contact with the other reactant phase is greater. For\nexample, large pieces of iron react more slowly with acids than they do with finely divided iron powder (Figure\n12.6). Large pieces of wood smolder, smaller pieces burn rapidly, and saw dust burns explosively.\nFIGURE 12.6\n(a) Iron powder reacts rapidly with dilute hydrochloric acid and produces bubbles of hydrogen gas:\n2Fe(s) + 6HCl(aq)\n2FeCl3(aq) + 3H2(g). (b) An iron nail reacts more slowly because the surface area exposed to\nthe acid is much less.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/16cesium) to see the reaction of cesium with water in slow motion and a\ndiscussion of how the state of reactants and particle size affect reaction rates.\nTemperature of the Reactants\nChemical reactions typically occur faster at higher temperatures. Food can spoil quickly when left on the\nkitchen counter. However, the lower temperature inside of a refrigerator slows that process so that the same\nfood remains fresh for days. Gas burners, hot plates, and ovens are often used in the laboratory to increase the\nspeed of reactions that proceed slowly at ordinary temperatures. For many chemical processes, reaction rates\nare approximately doubled when the temperature is raised by 10 °C.\nConcentrations of the Reactants\nThe rates of many reactions depend on the concentrations of the reactants. Rates usually increase when the\nconcentration of one or more of the reactants increases. For example, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) deteriorates\nas a result of its reaction with the pollutant sulfur dioxide. The rate of this reaction depends on the amount of\nsulfur dioxide in the air (Figure 12.7). An acidic oxide, sulfur dioxide combines with water vapor in the air to\nproduce sulfurous acid in the following reaction:\nCalcium carbonate reacts with sulfurous acid as follows:\nIn a polluted atmosphere where the concentration of sulfur dioxide is high, calcium carbonate deteriorates\nmore rapidly than in less polluted air. Similarly, phosphorus burns much more rapidly in an atmosphere of\npure oxygen than in air, which is only about 20% oxygen.\n606\n12 • Kinetics\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

The exponents m and n are the reaction orders\nand are typically positive integers, though they can be fractions, negative, or zero. The rate constant k and the\nreaction orders m and n must be determined experimentally by observing how the rate of a reaction changes\nas the concentrations of the reactants are changed. The rate constant k is independent of the reactant\nconcentrations, but it does vary with temperature.\nThe reaction orders in a rate law describe the mathematical dependence of the rate on reactant\nconcentrations. Referring to the generic rate law above, the reaction is m order with respect to A and n order\nwith respect to B. For example, if m = 1 and n = 2, the reaction is first order in A and second order in B. The\noverall reaction order is simply the sum of orders for each reactant.

To reduce this pollutant,\nautomobiles have catalytic converters that use a catalyst to carry out this reaction. It is also a side reaction of\nthe combustion of gunpowder that results in muzzle flash for many firearms. If carbon monoxide and oxygen\nare present in sufficient amounts, the reaction will occur at high temperature and pressure.\nThe first step in the gas-phase reaction between carbon monoxide and oxygen is a collision between the two\nmolecules:\nAlthough there are many different possible orientations the two molecules can have relative to each other,\nconsider the two presented in Figure 12.13. In the first case, the oxygen side of the carbon monoxide molecule\ncollides with the oxygen molecule. In the second case, the carbon side of the carbon monoxide molecule\ncollides with the oxygen molecule. The second case is clearly more likely to result in the formation of carbon\ndioxide, which has a central carbon atom bonded to two oxygen atoms\nThis is a rather simple\nexample of how important the orientation of the collision is in terms of creating the desired product of the\nreaction.\nFIGURE 12.13\nIllustrated are two collisions that might take place between carbon monoxide and oxygen\nmolecules. The orientation of the colliding molecules partially determines whether a reaction between the two\nmolecules will occur.\nIf the collision does take place with the correct orientation, there is still no guarantee that the reaction will\nproceed to form carbon dioxide. In addition to a proper orientation, the collision must also occur with\nsufficient energy to result in product formation. When reactant species collide with both proper orientation\nand adequate energy, they combine to form an unstable species called an activated complex or a transition\nstate. These species are very short lived and usually undetectable by most analytical instruments. In some\ncases, sophisticated spectral measurements have been used to observe transition states.\nCollision theory explains why most reaction rates increase as concentrations increase. With an increase in the\nconcentration of any reacting substance, the chances for collisions between molecules are increased because\nthere are more molecules per unit of volume. More collisions mean a faster reaction rate, assuming the energy\nof the collisions is adequate.\nActivation Energy and the Arrhenius Equation\nThe minimum energy necessary to form a product during a collision between reactants is called the activation\nenergy (Ea). How this energy compares to the kinetic energy provided by colliding reactant molecules is a\nprimary factor affecting the rate of a chemical reaction. If the activation energy is much larger than the\naverage kinetic energy of the molecules, the reaction will occur slowly since only a few fast-moving molecules\nwill have enough energy to react. If the activation energy is much smaller than the average kinetic energy of\nthe molecules, a large fraction of molecules will be adequately energetic and the reaction will proceed rapidly.\nFigure 12.14 shows how the energy of a chemical system changes as it undergoes a reaction converting\nreactants to products according to the equation\n626\n12 • Kinetics\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

The\nunstable transition state can then subsequently decay to yield stable products, C + D. The diagram depicts the\nreaction's activation energy, Ea, as the energy difference between the reactants and the transition state. Using a\nspecific energy, the enthalpy (see chapter on thermochemistry), the enthalpy change of the reaction, ΔH, is\nestimated as the energy difference between the reactants and products. In this case, the reaction is exothermic\n(ΔH < 0) since it yields a decrease in system enthalpy.\nFIGURE 12.14\nReaction diagram for the exothermic reaction\nThe Arrhenius equation relates the activation energy and the rate constant, k, for many chemical reactions:\nIn this equation, R is the ideal gas constant, which has a value 8.314 J/mol/K, T is temperature on the Kelvin\nscale, Ea is the activation energy in joules per mole, e is the constant 2.7183, and A is a constant called the\nfrequency factor, which is related to the frequency of collisions and the orientation of the reacting molecules.\nPostulates of collision theory are nicely accommodated by the Arrhenius equation. The frequency factor, A,\nreflects how well the reaction conditions favor properly oriented collisions between reactant molecules. An\nincreased probability of effectively oriented collisions results in larger values for A and faster reaction rates.\nThe exponential term, e−Ea/RT, describes the effect of activation energy on reaction rate. According to kinetic\nmolecular theory (see chapter on gases), the temperature of matter is a measure of the average kinetic energy\nof its constituent atoms or molecules. The distribution of energies among the molecules composing a sample\nof matter at any given temperature is described by the plot shown in Figure 12.15(a).

          "text": "integrated rate law for second-order reactions:\nhalf-life for a second-order reaction\nSummary\n12.1 Chemical Reaction Rates\nThe rate of a reaction can be expressed either in\nterms of the decrease in the amount of a reactant or\nthe increase in the amount of a product per unit\ntime. Relations between different rate expressions\nfor a given reaction are derived directly from the\nstoichiometric coefficients of the equation\nrepresenting the reaction.\n12.2 Factors Affecting Reaction Rates\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is affected by several\nparameters. Reactions involving two phases proceed\nmore rapidly when there is greater surface area\ncontact. If temperature or reactant concentration is\nincreased, the rate of a given reaction generally\nincreases as well. A catalyst can increase the rate of\na reaction by providing an alternative pathway with\na lower activation energy.\n12.3 Rate Laws\nRate laws (differential rate laws) provide a\nmathematical description of how changes in the\nconcentration of a substance affect the rate of a\nchemical reaction. Rate laws are determined\nexperimentally and cannot be predicted by reaction\nstoichiometry. The order of reaction describes how\nmuch a change in the concentration of each\nsubstance affects the overall rate, and the overall\norder of a reaction is the sum of the orders for each\nsubstance present in the reaction. Reaction orders\nare typically first order, second order, or zero order,\nbut fractional and even negative orders are possible.\n12.4 Integrated Rate Laws\nIntegrated rate laws are mathematically derived\nfrom differential rate laws, and they describe the\ntime dependence of reactant and product\nconcentrations.\nThe half-life of a reaction is the time required to\ndecrease the amount of a given reactant by one-half.\nA reaction’s half-life varies with rate constant and,\nfor some reaction orders, reactant concentration.\nThe half-life of a zero-order reaction decreases as\nthe initial concentration of the reactant in the\nreaction decreases. The half-life of a first-order\nreaction is independent of concentration, and the\nhalf-life of a second-order reaction decreases as the\nconcentration increases.\n12.5 Collision Theory\nChemical reactions typically require collisions\nbetween reactant species. These reactant collisions\nmust be of proper orientation and sufficient energy\nin order to result in product formation. Collision\ntheory provides a simple but effective explanation\nfor the effect of many experimental parameters on\nreaction rates. The Arrhenius equation describes the\nrelation between a reaction’s rate constant,\nactivation energy, temperature, and dependence on\ncollision orientation.\n12.6 Reaction Mechanisms\nThe sequence of individual steps, or elementary\nreactions, by which reactants are converted into\nproducts during the course of a reaction is called the\nreaction mechanism. The molecularity of an\nelementary reaction is the number of reactant\nspecies involved, typically one (unimolecular), two\n(bimolecular), or, less commonly, three\n(termolecular). The overall rate of a reaction is\ndetermined by the rate of the slowest in its\nmechanism, called the rate-determining step.\nUnimolecular elementary reactions have first-order\nrate laws, while bimolecular elementary reactions\nhave second-order rate laws. By comparing the rate\nlaws derived from a reaction mechanism to that\ndetermined experimentally, the mechanism may be\ndeemed either incorrect or plausible.\n12.7 Catalysis\nCatalysts affect the rate of a chemical reaction by\naltering its mechanism to provide a lower activation\nenergy.

As those basking in the sun get\ntoo hot, they enter the surf to swim and cool off. As the swimmers tire, they return to the beach to rest. If the\nrate at which sunbathers enter the surf were to equal the rate at which swimmers return to the sand, then the\nnumbers (though not the identities) of sunbathers and swimmers would remain constant. This scenario\nillustrates a dynamic phenomenon known as equilibrium, in which opposing processes occur at equal rates.\nChemical and physical processes are subject to this phenomenon; these processes are at equilibrium when the\nforward and reverse reaction rates are equal. Equilibrium systems are pervasive in nature; the various\nreactions involving carbon dioxide dissolved in blood are examples (see Figure 13.1).

By this convention, and the definitions of “reactant” and\n“product,” a chemical equation represents the reaction in question as proceeding from left to right. Reversible\nreactions, however, may proceed in both forward (left to right) and reverse (right to left) directions. When the\nrates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal, the concentrations of the reactant and product species\nremain constant over time and the system is at equilibrium. The relative concentrations of reactants and\nproducts in equilibrium systems vary greatly; some systems contain mostly products at equilibrium, some\ncontain mostly reactants, and some contain appreciable amounts of both.\nFigure 13.2 illustrates fundamental equilibrium concepts using the reversible decomposition of colorless\ndinitrogen tetroxide to yield brown nitrogen dioxide, an elementary reaction described by the equation:\nNote that a special double arrow is used to emphasize the reversible nature of the reaction.\nFIGURE 13.2\n(a) A sealed tube containing colorless N2O4 darkens as it decomposes to yield brown NO2.

          "text": "For this elementary process, rate laws for the forward and reverse reactions may be derived directly from the\nreaction stoichiometry:\nAs the reaction begins (t = 0), the concentration of the N2O4 reactant is finite and that of the NO2 product is\nzero, so the forward reaction proceeds at a finite rate while the reverse reaction rate is zero. As time passes,\nN2O4 is consumed and its concentration falls, while NO2 is produced and its concentration increases (Figure\n13.2b). The decreasing concentration of the reactant slows the forward reaction rate, and the increasing\nproduct concentration speeds the reverse reaction rate (Figure 13.2c). This process continues until the\nforward and reverse reaction rates become equal, at which time the reaction has reached equilibrium, as\ncharacterized by constant concentrations of its reactants and products (shaded areas of Figure 13.2b and\nFigure 13.2c). It’s important to emphasize that chemical equilibria are dynamic; a reaction at equilibrium has\nnot “stopped,” but is proceeding in the forward and reverse directions at the same rate. This dynamic nature is\nessential to understanding equilibrium behavior as discussed in this and subsequent chapters of the text.\nFIGURE 13.3\nA two-person juggling act illustrates the dynamic aspect of chemical equilibria. Each person is\nthrowing and catching clubs at the same rate, and each holds a (approximately) constant number of clubs.\nPhysical changes, such as phase transitions, are also reversible and may establish equilibria. This concept was\nintroduced in another chapter of this text through discussion of the vapor pressure of a condensed phase\n(liquid or solid). As one example, consider the vaporization of bromine:\nWhen liquid bromine is added to an otherwise empty container and the container is sealed, the forward\nprocess depicted above (vaporization) will commence and continue at a roughly constant rate as long as the\nexposed surface area of the liquid and its temperature remain constant. As increasing amounts of gaseous\nbromine are produced, the rate of the reverse process (condensation) will increase until it equals the rate of\nvaporization and equilibrium is established.

Consequently, changes in concentration and\ntemperature are the two stresses that can shift an equilibrium.\nEffect of a Change in Concentration\nIf an equilibrium system is subjected to a change in the concentration of a reactant or product species, the rate\nof either the forward or the reverse reaction will change. As an example, consider the equilibrium reaction\nThe rate laws for the forward and reverse reactions are\nWhen this system is at equilibrium, the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal.\nIf the system is stressed by adding reactant, either H2 or I2, the resulting increase in concentration causes the\nrate of the forward reaction to increase, exceeding that of the reverse reaction:\nThe system will experience a temporary net reaction in the forward direction to re-establish equilibrium (the\nequilibrium will shift right). This same shift will result if some product HI is removed from the system, which\ndecreases the rate of the reverse reaction, again resulting in the same imbalance in rates.\nThe same logic can be used to explain the left shift that results from either removing reactant or adding\nproduct to an equilibrium system. These stresses both result in an increased rate for the reverse reaction\nand a temporary net reaction in the reverse direction to re-establish equilibrium.\nAs an alternative to this kinetic interpretation, the effect of changes in concentration on equilibria can be\nrationalized in terms of reaction quotients. When the system is at equilibrium,\nIf reactant is added (increasing the denominator of the reaction quotient) or product is removed (decreasing\nthe numerator), then Qc < Kc and the equilibrium will shift right. Note that the three different ways of inducing\nthis stress result in three different changes in the composition of the equilibrium mixture. If H2 is added, the\nright shift will consume I2 and produce HI as equilibrium is re-established, yielding a mixture with a greater\nconcentrations of H2 and HI and a lesser concentration of I2 than was present before. If I2 is added, the new\nequilibrium mixture will have greater concentrations of I2 and HI and a lesser concentration of H2. Finally, if HI\nis removed, the concentrations of all three species will be lower when equilibrium is reestablished. Despite\nthese differences in composition, the value of the equilibrium constant will be the same after the stress as it\nwas before (per the law of mass action). The same logic may be applied for stresses involving removing\nreactants or adding product, in which case Qc > Kc and the equilibrium will shift left.\nFor gas-phase equilibria such as this one, some additional perspectives on changing the concentrations of\nreactants and products are worthy of mention. The partial pressure P of an ideal gas is proportional to its\nmolar concentration M,\nand so changes in the partial pressures of any reactant or product are essentially changes in concentrations\nand thus yield the same effects on equilibria.

          "text": "The acid-base reaction class has been studied for quite some time. In 1680, Robert Boyle reported traits of acid\nsolutions that included their ability to dissolve many substances, to change the colors of certain natural dyes,\nand to lose these traits after coming in contact with alkali (base) solutions. In the eighteenth century, it was\nrecognized that acids have a sour taste, react with limestone to liberate a gaseous substance (now known to be\nCO2), and interact with alkalis to form neutral substances. In 1815, Humphry Davy contributed greatly to the\ndevelopment of the modern acid-base concept by demonstrating that hydrogen is the essential constituent of\nacids. Around that same time, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac concluded that acids are substances that can\nneutralize bases and that these two classes of substances can be defined only in terms of each other. The\nsignificance of hydrogen was reemphasized in 1884 when Svante Arrhenius defined an acid as a compound\nthat dissolves in water to yield hydrogen cations (now recognized to be hydronium ions) and a base as a\ncompound that dissolves in water to yield hydroxide anions.\nJohannes Brønsted and Thomas Lowry proposed a more general description in 1923 in which acids and bases\nwere defined in terms of the transfer of hydrogen ions, H+. (Note that these hydrogen ions are often referred to\nsimply as protons, since that subatomic particle is the only component of cations derived from the most\nabundant hydrogen isotope, 1H.) A compound that donates a proton to another compound is called a\nBrønsted-Lowry acid, and a compound that accepts a proton is called a Brønsted-Lowry base. An acid-base\nreaction is, thus, the transfer of a proton from a donor (acid) to an acceptor (base).\nThe concept of conjugate pairs is useful in describing Brønsted-Lowry acid-base reactions (and other\nreversible reactions, as well). When an acid donates H+, the species that remains is called the conjugate base\nof the acid because it reacts as a proton acceptor in the reverse reaction. Likewise, when a base accepts H+, it is\nconverted to its conjugate acid. The reaction between water and ammonia illustrates this idea. In the forward\ndirection, water acts as an acid by donating a proton to ammonia and subsequently becoming a hydroxide ion,\nOH−, the conjugate base of water. The ammonia acts as a base in accepting this proton, becoming an\nammonium ion,\nthe conjugate acid of ammonia. In the reverse direction, a hydroxide ion acts as a base\nin accepting a proton from ammonium ion, which acts as an acid.\nThe reaction between a Brønsted-Lowry acid and water is called acid ionization. For example, when hydrogen\nfluoride dissolves in water and ionizes, protons are transferred from hydrogen fluoride molecules to water\nmolecules, yielding hydronium ions and fluoride ions:\nBase ionization of a species occurs when it accepts protons from water molecules. In the example below,\npyridine molecules, C5NH5, undergo base ionization when dissolved in water, yielding hydroxide and\npyridinium ions:\n694\n14 • Acid-Base Equilibria\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

          "text": "The preceding ionization reactions suggest that water may function as both a base (as in its reaction with\nhydrogen fluoride) and an acid (as in its reaction with ammonia). Species capable of either donating or\naccepting protons are called amphiprotic, or more generally, amphoteric, a term that may be used for acids\nand bases per definitions other than the Brønsted-Lowry one. The equations below show the two possible acid-\nbase reactions for two amphiprotic species, bicarbonate ion and water:\nThe first equation represents the reaction of bicarbonate as an acid with water as a base, whereas the second\nrepresents reaction of bicarbonate as a base with water as an acid. When bicarbonate is added to water, both\nthese equilibria are established simultaneously and the composition of the resulting solution may be\ndetermined through appropriate equilibrium calculations, as described later in this chapter.\nIn the liquid state, molecules of an amphiprotic substance can react with one another as illustrated for water in\nthe equations below:\nThe process in which like molecules react to yield ions is called autoionization. Liquid water undergoes\nautoionization to a very slight extent; at 25 °C, approximately two out of every billion water molecules are\nionized. The extent of the water autoionization process is reflected in the value of its equilibrium constant, the\nion-product constant for water, Kw:\nThe slight ionization of pure water is reflected in the small value of the equilibrium constant; at 25 °C, Kw has a\nvalue of 1.0\n10−14. The process is endothermic, and so the extent of ionization and the resulting\nconcentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion increase with temperature. For example, at 100 °C, the\nvalue for Kw is about 5.6\n10−13, roughly 50 times larger than the value at 25 °C.\nEXAMPLE 14.1\nIon Concentrations in Pure Water\nWhat are the hydronium ion concentration and the hydroxide ion concentration in pure water at 25 °C?\nSolution\nThe autoionization of water yields the same number of hydronium and hydroxide ions.

Examples of such compounds include sulfuric acid, O2S(OH)2, sulfurous acid, OS(OH)2, nitric acid,\nO2NOH, perchloric acid, O3ClOH, aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, and potassium\nhydroxide, KOH:\nIf the central atom, E, has a low electronegativity, its attraction for electrons is low. Little tendency exists for the\ncentral atom to form a strong covalent bond with the oxygen atom, and bond a between the element and\noxygen is more readily broken than bond b between oxygen and hydrogen. Hence bond a is ionic, hydroxide\nions are released to the solution, and the material behaves as a base—this is the case with Ca(OH)2 and KOH.\nLower electronegativity is characteristic of the more metallic elements; hence, the metallic elements form\nionic hydroxides that are by definition basic compounds.\nIf, on the other hand, the atom E has a relatively high electronegativity, it strongly attracts the electrons it\nshares with the oxygen atom, making bond a relatively strongly covalent. The oxygen-hydrogen bond, bond b,\nis thereby weakened because electrons are displaced toward E. Bond b is polar and readily releases hydrogen\nions to the solution, so the material behaves as an acid. High electronegativities are characteristic of the more\nnonmetallic elements. Thus, nonmetallic elements form covalent compounds containing acidic −OH groups\nthat are called oxyacids.\nIncreasing the oxidation number of the central atom E also increases the acidity of an oxyacid because this\nincreases the attraction of E for the electrons it shares with oxygen and thereby weakens the O-H bond.\nSulfuric acid, H2SO4, or O2S(OH)2 (with a sulfur oxidation number of +6), is more acidic than sulfurous acid,\n14.3 • Relative Strengths of Acids and Bases\n715",

The carbonate buffer system in the blood uses the following\nequilibrium reaction:\nPortrait of a Chemist\nLawrence Joseph Henderson and Karl Albert Hasselbalch\nLawrence Joseph Henderson (1878–1942) was an American physician, biochemist and physiologist, to\nname only a few of his many pursuits. He obtained a medical degree from Harvard and then spent 2 years\nstudying in Strasbourg, then a part of Germany, before returning to take a lecturer position at Harvard. He\neventually became a professor at Harvard and worked there his entire life. He discovered that the acid-base\nbalance in human blood is regulated by a buffer system formed by the dissolved carbon dioxide in blood.\nHe wrote an equation in 1908 to describe the carbonic acid-carbonate buffer system in blood. Henderson\nwas broadly knowledgeable; in addition to his important research on the physiology of blood, he also wrote\non the adaptations of organisms and their fit with their environments, on sociology and on university\neducation. He also founded the Fatigue Laboratory, at the Harvard Business School, which examined\nhuman physiology with specific focus on work in industry, exercise, and nutrition.\nIn 1916, Karl Albert Hasselbalch (1874–1962), a Danish physician and chemist, shared authorship in a\npaper with Christian Bohr in 1904 that described the Bohr effect, which showed that the ability of\nhemoglobin in the blood to bind with oxygen was inversely related to the acidity of the blood and the\nconcentration of carbon dioxide. The pH scale was introduced in 1909 by another Dane, Sørensen, and in\n1912, Hasselbalch published measurements of the pH of blood. In 1916, Hasselbalch expressed\nHenderson’s equation in logarithmic terms, consistent with the logarithmic scale of pH, and thus the\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation was born.\n14.6 • Buffers\n729",

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and the pKa of carbonic\nacid at body temperature, we can calculate the pH of blood:\nThe fact that the H2CO3 concentration is significantly lower than that of the\nion may seem unusual, but\nthis imbalance is due to the fact that most of the by-products of our metabolism that enter our bloodstream are\nacidic. Therefore, there must be a larger proportion of base than acid, so that the capacity of the buffer will not\nbe exceeded.\nLactic acid is produced in our muscles when we exercise. As the lactic acid enters the bloodstream, it is\nneutralized by the\nion, producing H2CO3. An enzyme then accelerates the breakdown of the excess\ncarbonic acid to carbon dioxide and water, which can be eliminated by breathing. In fact, in addition to the\nregulating effects of the carbonate buffering system on the pH of blood, the body uses breathing to regulate\nblood pH. If the pH of the blood decreases too far, an increase in breathing removes CO2 from the blood\nthrough the lungs driving the equilibrium reaction such that [H3O+] is lowered. If the blood is too alkaline, a\nlower breath rate increases CO2 concentration in the blood, driving the equilibrium reaction the other way,\nincreasing [H+] and restoring an appropriate pH.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView information (http://openstax.org/l/16BufferSystem) on the buffer system encountered in natural waters.\n14.7 Acid-Base Titrations\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nInterpret titration curves for strong and weak acid-base systems\n•\nCompute sample pH at important stages of a titration\n•\nExplain the function of acid-base indicators\nAs seen in the chapter on the stoichiometry of chemical reactions, titrations can be used to quantitatively\nanalyze solutions for their acid or base concentrations.

A comparison of these two curves illustrates several\nimportant concepts that are best addressed by identifying the four stages of a titration:\ninitial state (added titrant volume = 0 mL): pH is determined by the acid being titrated; because the two acid\nsamples are equally concentrated, the weak acid will exhibit a greater initial pH\npre-equivalence point (0 mL < V < 25 mL): solution pH increases gradually and the acid is consumed by\nreaction with added titrant; composition includes unreacted acid and the reaction product, its conjugate base\nequivalence point (V = 25 mL): a drastic rise in pH is observed as the solution composition transitions from\nacidic to either neutral (for the strong acid sample) or basic (for the weak acid sample), with pH determined by\nionization of the conjugate base of the acid\npostequivalence point (V > 25 mL): pH is determined by the amount of excess strong base titrant added; since\nboth samples are titrated with the same titrant, both titration curves appear similar at this stage.\npH Values in the Titrations of a Strong Acid and of a Weak Acid\nVolume of 0.100 M NaOH\nAdded (mL)\nMoles of NaOH\nAdded\npH Values 0.100 M\nHCl1\npH Values 0.100 M\nCH3CO2H2\n0.0\n0.0\n1.00\n2.87\n5.0\n0.00050\n1.18\n4.14\n10.0\n0.00100\n1.37\n4.57\n15.0\n0.00150\n1.60\n4.92\n20.0\n0.00200\n1.95\n5.35\n22.0\n0.00220\n2.20\n5.61\n24.0\n0.00240\n2.69\n6.13\n24.5\n0.00245\n3.00\n6.44\n24.9\n0.00249\n3.70\n7.14\n25.0\n0.00250\n7.00\n8.72\n25.1\n0.00251\n10.30\n10.30\n25.5\n0.00255\n11.00\n11.00\n26.0\n0.00260\n11.29\n11.29\n1\nTitration of 25.00 mL of 0.100 M HCl (0.00250 mol of HCI) with 0.100 M NaOH.\n2\nTitration of 25.00 mL of 0.100 M CH3CO2H (0.00250 mol of CH3CO2H) with 0.100 M NaOH.\n14.7 • Acid-Base Titrations\n733",

For example, phenolphthalein is a colorless substance in any aqueous solution with a\nhydronium ion concentration greater than 5.0\n10−9 M (pH < 8.3). In more basic solutions where the\nhydronium ion concentration is less than 5.0\n10−9 M (pH > 8.3), it is red or pink. Substances such as\nphenolphthalein, which can be used to determine the pH of a solution, are called acid-base indicators. Acid-\nbase indicators are either weak organic acids or weak organic bases.\nThe equilibrium in a solution of the acid-base indicator methyl orange, a weak acid, can be represented by an\nequation in which we use HIn as a simple representation for the complex methyl orange molecule:\n734\n14 • Acid-Base Equilibria\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

          "text": "The anion of methyl orange, In−, is yellow, and the nonionized form, HIn, is red. When we add acid to a solution\nof methyl orange, the increased hydronium ion concentration shifts the equilibrium toward the nonionized red\nform, in accordance with Le Châtelier’s principle. If we add base, we shift the equilibrium towards the yellow\nform. This behavior is completely analogous to the action of buffers.\nThe perceived color of an indicator solution is determined by the ratio of the concentrations of the two species\nIn−and HIn. If most of the indicator (typically about 60−90% or more) is present as In−, the perceived color of\nthe solution is yellow. If most is present as HIn, then the solution color appears red. The Henderson-\nHasselbalch equation is useful for understanding the relationship between the pH of an indicator solution and\nits composition (thus, perceived color):\nIn solutions where pH > pKa, the logarithmic term must be positive, indicating an excess of the conjugate base\nform of the indicator (yellow solution). When pH < pKa, the log term must be negative, indicating an excess of\nthe conjugate acid (red solution). When the solution pH is close to the indicator pKa, appreciable amounts of\nboth conjugate partners are present, and the solution color is that of an additive combination of each (yellow\nand red, yielding orange). The color change interval (or pH interval) for an acid-base indicator is defined as\nthe range of pH values over which a change in color is observed, and for most indicators this range is\napproximately pKa ± 1.\nThere are many different acid-base indicators that cover a wide range of pH values and can be used to\ndetermine the approximate pH of an unknown solution by a process of elimination. Universal indicators and\npH paper contain a mixture of indicators and exhibit different colors at different pHs. Figure 14.19 presents\nseveral indicators, their colors, and their color-change intervals.\n14.7 • Acid-Base Titrations\n735",

Any\nof the three indicators will exhibit a reasonably sharp color change at the equivalence point of the strong acid\ntitration, but only phenolphthalein is suitable for use in the weak acid titration.\nThe titration curves shown in Figure 14.20 illustrate the choice of a suitable indicator for specific titrations. In\nthe strong acid titration, use of any of the three indicators should yield reasonably sharp color changes and\naccurate end point determinations. For this titration, the solution pH reaches the lower limit of the methyl\norange color change interval after addition of ~24 mL of titrant, at which point the initially red solution would\nbegin to appear orange. When 25 mL of titrant has been added (the equivalence point), the pH is well above the\nupper limit and the solution will appear yellow. The titration's end point may then be estimated as the volume\nof titrant that yields a distinct orange-to-yellow color change. This color change would be challenging for most\nhuman eyes to precisely discern. More-accurate estimates of the titration end point are possible using either\nlitmus or phenolphthalein, both of which exhibit color change intervals that are encompassed by the steep rise\nin pH that occurs around the 25.00 mL equivalence point.\nThe weak acid titration curve in Figure 14.20 shows that only one of the three indicators is suitable for end\npoint detection. If methyl orange is used in this titration, the solution will undergo a gradual red-to-orange-to-\nyellow color change over a relatively large volume interval (0–6 mL), completing the color change well before\nthe equivalence point (25 mL) has been reached. Use of litmus would show a color change that begins after\nadding 7–8 mL of titrant and ends just before the equivalence point. Phenolphthalein, on the other hand,\nexhibits a color change interval that nicely brackets the abrupt change in pH occurring at the titration's\nequivalence point. A sharp color change from colorless to pink will be observed within a very small volume\ninterval around the equivalence point.\n14.7 • Acid-Base Titrations\n737",

The compound that accepts the proton\nis called a Brønsted-Lowry base. The species\nremaining after a Brønsted-Lowry acid has lost a\nproton is the conjugate base of the acid. The species\nformed when a Brønsted-Lowry base gains a proton\nis the conjugate acid of the base. Thus, an acid-base\nreaction occurs when a proton is transferred from\nan acid to a base, with formation of the conjugate\nbase of the reactant acid and formation of the\nconjugate acid of the reactant base. Amphiprotic\nspecies can act as both proton donors and proton\nacceptors. Water is the most important amphiprotic\nspecies. It can form both the hydronium ion, H3O+,\nand the hydroxide ion, OH−when it undergoes\nautoionization:\nThe ion product of water, Kw is the equilibrium\nconstant for the autoionization reaction:\n14.2 pH and pOH\nConcentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions in\naqueous media are often represented as logarithmic\npH and pOH values, respectively. At 25 °C, the\nautoprotolysis equilibrium for water requires the\nsum of pH and pOH to equal 14 for any aqueous\nsolution. The relative concentrations of hydronium\nand hydroxide ion in a solution define its status as\nacidic ([H3O+] > [OH−]), basic ([H3O+] < [OH−]), or\nneutral ([H3O+] = [OH−]). At 25 °C, a pH < 7 indicates\nan acidic solution, a pH > 7 a basic solution, and a\npH = 7 a neutral solution.\n14.3 Relative Strengths of Acids and Bases\nThe relative strengths of acids and bases are\nreflected in the magnitudes of their ionization\nconstants; the stronger the acid or base, the larger\nits ionization constant. A reciprocal relation exists\nbetween the strengths of a conjugate acid-base pair:\nthe stronger the acid, the weaker its conjugate base.\nWater exerts a leveling effect on dissolved acids or\nbases, reacting completely to generate its\ncharacteristic hydronium and hydroxide ions (the\nstrongest acid and base that may exist in water). The\nstrengths of the binary acids increase from left to\nright across a period of the periodic table (CH4 < NH3\n< H2O < HF), and they increase down a group (HF <\nHCl < HBr < HI). The strengths of oxyacids that\ncontain the same central element increase as the\noxidation number of the element increases (H2SO3 <\nH2SO4). The strengths of oxyacids also increase as\nthe electronegativity of the central element\nincreases [H2SeO4 < H2SO4].\n14.4 Hydrolysis of Salts\nThe ions composing salts may possess acidic or\nbasic character, ionizing when dissolved in water to\nyield acidic or basic solutions. Acidic cations are\ntypically the conjugate partners of weak bases, and\nbasic anions are the conjugate partners of weak\nacids. Many metal ions bond to water molecules\nwhen dissolved to yield complex ions that may\nfunction as acids.\n14.5 Polyprotic Acids\nAn acid that contains more than one ionizable\nproton is a polyprotic acid. These acids undergo\nstepwise ionization reactions involving the transfer\nof single protons. The ionization constants for\npolyprotic acids decrease with each subsequent\nstep; these decreases typically are large enough to\npermit simple equilibrium calculations that treat\neach step separately.\n14.6 Buffers\nSolutions that contain appreciable amounts of a\nweak conjugate acid-base pair are called buffers. A\nbuffered solution will experience only slight changes\nin pH when small amounts of acid or base are added.\nAddition of large amounts of acid or base can exceed\nthe buffer capacity, consuming most of one\n14 • Summary\n739",

An understanding of the factors affecting compound solubility is, therefore, essential to the\neffective management of these processes. This section applies previously introduced equilibrium concepts\nand tools to systems involving dissolution and precipitation.\nThe Solubility Product\nRecall from the chapter on solutions that the solubility of a substance can vary from essentially zero (insoluble\nor sparingly soluble) to infinity (miscible). A solute with finite solubility can yield a saturated solution when it\nis added to a solvent in an amount exceeding its solubility, resulting in a heterogeneous mixture of the\nsaturated solution and the excess, undissolved solute. For example, a saturated solution of silver chloride is\none in which the equilibrium shown below has been established.\nIn this solution, an excess of solid AgCl dissolves and dissociates to produce aqueous Ag+ and Cl– ions at the\nsame rate that these aqueous ions combine and precipitate to form solid AgCl (Figure 15.2). Because silver\nchloride is a sparingly soluble salt, the equilibrium concentration of its dissolved ions in the solution is\nrelatively low.\nFIGURE 15.2\nSilver chloride is a sparingly soluble ionic solid. When it is added to water, it dissolves slightly and\nproduces a mixture consisting of a very dilute solution of Ag+ and Cl– ions in equilibrium with undissolved silver\nchloride.\nThe equilibrium constant for solubility equilibria such as this one is called the solubility product constant,\nKsp, in this case\nRecall that only gases and solutes are represented in equilibrium constant expressions, so the Ksp does not\ninclude a term for the undissolved AgCl. A listing of solubility product constants for several sparingly soluble\ncompounds is provided in Appendix J.\nEXAMPLE 15.1\nWriting Equations and Solubility Products\nWrite the dissolution equation and the solubility product expression for each of the following slightly soluble\nionic compounds:\n(a) AgI, silver iodide, a solid with antiseptic properties\n(b) CaCO3, calcium carbonate, the active ingredient in many over-the-counter chewable antacids\n(c) Mg(OH)2, magnesium hydroxide, the active ingredient in Milk of Magnesia\n(d) Mg(NH4)PO4, magnesium ammonium phosphate, an essentially insoluble substance used in tests for\n750\n15 • Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Consider, for example, mixing\naqueous solutions of the soluble compounds sodium carbonate and calcium nitrate. If the concentrations of\ncalcium and carbonate ions in the mixture do not yield a reaction quotient, Qsp, that exceeds the solubility\nproduct, Ksp, then no precipitation will occur. If the ion concentrations yield a reaction quotient greater than\nthe solubility product, then precipitation will occur, lowering those concentrations until equilibrium is\nestablished (Qsp = Ksp). The comparison of Qsp to Ksp to predict precipitation is an example of the general\napproach to predicting the direction of a reaction first introduced in the chapter on equilibrium. For the\nspecific case of solubility equilibria:\nQsp < Ksp: the reaction proceeds in the forward direction (solution is not saturated; no precipitation observed)\nQsp > Ksp: the reaction proceeds in the reverse direction (solution is supersaturated; precipitation will occur)\nThis predictive strategy and related calculations are demonstrated in the next few example exercises.\n756\n15 • Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Specifically, selective precipitation is used to remove\ncontaminants from wastewater before it is released back into natural bodies of water. For example,\nphosphate ions\nare often present in the water discharged from manufacturing facilities. An\nabundance of phosphate causes excess algae to grow, which impacts the amount of oxygen available for\nmarine life as well as making water unsuitable for human consumption.\nFIGURE 15.6\nWastewater treatment facilities, such as this one, remove contaminants from wastewater before\nthe water is released back into the natural environment. (credit: “eutrophication&hypoxia”/Wikimedia\nCommons)\nOne common way to remove phosphates from water is by the addition of calcium hydroxide, or lime,\nCa(OH)2. As the water is made more basic, the calcium ions react with phosphate ions to produce\nhydroxylapatite, Ca5(PO4)3OH, which then precipitates out of the solution:\nBecause the amount of calcium ion added does not result in exceeding the solubility products for other\ncalcium salts, the anions of those salts remain behind in the wastewater. The precipitate is then removed\nby filtration and the water is brought back to a neutral pH by the addition of CO2 in a recarbonation\nprocess. Other chemicals can also be used for the removal of phosphates by precipitation, including\niron(III) chloride and aluminum sulfate.\nView this site (http://openstax.org/l/16Wastewater) for more information on how phosphorus is removed\nfrom wastewater.\n760\n15 • Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Toothpastes and mouthwashes also contain amounts of fluoride (Figure 15.9).\nFIGURE 15.9\nFluoride, found in many toothpastes, helps prevent tooth decay (credit: Kerry Ceszyk).\nUnfortunately, excess fluoride can negate its advantages. Natural sources of drinking water in various parts\nof the world have varying concentrations of fluoride, and places where that concentration is high are prone\nto certain health risks when there is no other source of drinking water. The most serious side effect of\nexcess fluoride is the bone disease, skeletal fluorosis. When excess fluoride is in the body, it can cause the\njoints to stiffen and the bones to thicken. It can severely impact mobility and can negatively affect the\nthyroid gland. Skeletal fluorosis is a condition that over 2.7 million people suffer from across the world. So\nwhile fluoride can protect our teeth from decay, the US Environmental Protection Agency sets a maximum\nlevel of 4 ppm (4 mg/L) of fluoride in drinking water in the US.

Common examples of\ncoupled equilibria include the increased solubility of\nsome compounds in acidic solutions (coupled\ndissolution and neutralization equilibria) and in\nsolutions containing ligands (coupled dissolution\nand complex formation). The equilibrium tools from\nother chapters may be applied to describe and\nperform calculations on these systems.\n772\n15 • Key Terms\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Thermodynamics, the study of relationships between the energy and work\nassociated with chemical and physical processes, provides this predictive ability. Previous chapters in this text\nhave described various applications of thermochemistry, an important aspect of thermodynamics concerned\nwith the heat flow accompanying chemical reactions and phase transitions. This chapter will introduce\nadditional thermodynamic concepts, including those that enable the prediction of any chemical or physical\nchanges under a given set of conditions.\n16.1 Spontaneity\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDistinguish between spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes\n•\nDescribe the dispersal of matter and energy that accompanies certain spontaneous processes\nFigure 16.1\nGeysers are a dramatic display of thermodynamic principles in nature. Water deep within the\nunderground channels of the geyser is under high pressure and heated to high temperature by magma. When a\npocket of water near the surface reaches boiling point and is expelled, the resulting drop in pressure causes larger\nvolumes of water to flash boil, forcefully ejecting steam and water in an impressive eruption.

          "text": "Processes have a natural tendency to occur in one direction under a given set of conditions. Water will\nnaturally flow downhill, but uphill flow requires outside intervention such as the use of a pump. Iron exposed\nto the earth’s atmosphere will corrode, but rust is not converted to iron without intentional chemical\ntreatment. A spontaneous process is one that occurs naturally under certain conditions. A nonspontaneous\nprocess, on the other hand, will not take place unless it is “driven” by the continual input of energy from an\nexternal source. A process that is spontaneous in one direction under a particular set of conditions is\nnonspontaneous in the reverse direction. At room temperature and typical atmospheric pressure, for example,\nice will spontaneously melt, but water will not spontaneously freeze.\nThe spontaneity of a process is not correlated to the speed of the process. A spontaneous change may be so\nrapid that it is essentially instantaneous or so slow that it cannot be observed over any practical period of time.\nTo illustrate this concept, consider the decay of radioactive isotopes, a topic more thoroughly treated in the\nchapter on nuclear chemistry. Radioactive decay is by definition a spontaneous process in which the nuclei of\nunstable isotopes emit radiation as they are converted to more stable nuclei. All the decay processes occur\nspontaneously, but the rates at which different isotopes decay vary widely. Technetium-99m is a popular\nradioisotope for medical imaging studies that undergoes relatively rapid decay and exhibits a half-life of about\nsix hours. Uranium-238 is the most abundant isotope of uranium, and its decay occurs much more slowly,\nexhibiting a half-life of more than four billion years (Figure 16.2).\nFIGURE 16.2\nBoth U-238 and Tc-99m undergo spontaneous radioactive decay, but at drastically different rates.\nOver the course of one week, essentially all of a Tc-99m sample and none of a U-238 sample will have decayed.\nAs another example, consider the conversion of diamond into graphite (Figure 16.3).\nThe phase diagram for carbon indicates that graphite is the stable form of this element under ambient\natmospheric pressure, while diamond is the stable allotrope at very high pressures, such as those present\nduring its geologic formation. Thermodynamic calculations of the sort described in the last section of this\nchapter indicate that the conversion of diamond to graphite at ambient pressure occurs spontaneously, yet\ndiamonds are observed to exist, and persist, under these conditions. Though the process is spontaneous under\ntypical ambient conditions, its rate is extremely slow; so, for all practical purposes diamonds are indeed\n“forever.” Situations such as these emphasize the important distinction between the thermodynamic and the\nkinetic aspects of a process. In this particular case, diamonds are said to be thermodynamically unstable but\nkinetically stable under ambient conditions.\n784\n16 • Thermodynamics\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Initially there is an ideal gas in\none flask and the other flask is empty (P = 0). (Figure 16.4). When the valve is opened, the gas spontaneously\nexpands to fill both flasks equally. Recalling the definition of pressure-volume work from the chapter on\nthermochemistry, note that no work has been done because the pressure in a vacuum is zero.\nNote as well that since the system is isolated, no heat has been exchanged with the surroundings (q = 0). The\nfirst law of thermodynamics confirms that there has been no change in the system’s internal energy as a result\nof this process.\nThe spontaneity of this process is therefore not a consequence of any change in energy that accompanies the\nprocess. Instead, the driving force appears to be related to the greater, more uniform dispersal of matter that\nresults when the gas is allowed to expand. Initially, the system was comprised of one flask containing matter\nand another flask containing nothing. After the spontaneous expansion took place, the matter was distributed\nboth more widely (occupying twice its original volume) and more uniformly (present in equal amounts in each\nflask).\nFIGURE 16.4\nAn isolated system consists of an ideal gas in one flask that is connected by a closed valve to a\n16.1 • Spontaneity\n785",

This corresponds to a loss of thermal energy by X and a gain of thermal energy\nby Y.\nFrom the perspective of this two-object system, there was no net gain or loss of thermal energy, rather the\navailable thermal energy was redistributed among the two objects. This spontaneous process resulted in a\nmore uniform dispersal of energy.\nFIGURE 16.5\nWhen two objects at different temperatures come in contact, heat spontaneously flows from the\nhotter to the colder object.\nAs illustrated by the two processes described, an important factor in determining the spontaneity of a process\nis the extent to which it changes the dispersal or distribution of matter and/or energy.

A later review of Carnot’s findings by Rudolf Clausius\nintroduced a new thermodynamic property that relates the spontaneous heat flow accompanying a process to\nthe temperature at which the process takes place. This new property was expressed as the ratio of the\nreversible heat (qrev) and the kelvin temperature (T). In thermodynamics, a reversible process is one that\ntakes place at such a slow rate that it is always at equilibrium and its direction can be changed (it can be\n“reversed”) by an infinitesimally small change in some condition. Note that the idea of a reversible process is a\nformalism required to support the development of various thermodynamic concepts; no real processes are\ntruly reversible, rather they are classified as irreversible.\nFIGURE 16.7\n(a) Nicholas Léonard Sadi Carnot’s research into steam-powered machinery and (b) Rudolf Clausius’s\nlater study of those findings led to groundbreaking discoveries about spontaneous heat flow processes.\nSimilar to other thermodynamic properties, this new quantity is a state function, so its change depends only\nupon the initial and final states of a system. In 1865, Clausius named this property entropy (S) and defined its\nchange for any process as the following:\n16.2 • Entropy\n787",

          "text": "The entropy change for a real, irreversible process is then equal to that for the theoretical reversible process\nthat involves the same initial and final states.\nEntropy and Microstates\nFollowing the work of Carnot and Clausius, Ludwig Boltzmann developed a molecular-scale statistical model\nthat related the entropy of a system to the number of microstates (W) possible for the system. A microstate is a\nspecific configuration of all the locations and energies of the atoms or molecules that make up a system. The\nrelation between a system’s entropy and the number of possible microstates is\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant, 1.38\n10−23 J/K.\nAs for other state functions, the change in entropy for a process is the difference between its final (Sf) and\ninitial (Si) values:\nFor processes involving an increase in the number of microstates, Wf > Wi, the entropy of the system increases\nand ΔS > 0. Conversely, processes that reduce the number of microstates, Wf < Wi, yield a decrease in system\nentropy, ΔS < 0. This molecular-scale interpretation of entropy provides a link to the probability that a process\nwill occur as illustrated in the next paragraphs.\nConsider the general case of a system comprised of N particles distributed among n boxes. The number of\nmicrostates possible for such a system is nN. For example, distributing four particles among two boxes will\nresult in 24 = 16 different microstates as illustrated in Figure 16.8. Microstates with equivalent particle\narrangements (not considering individual particle identities) are grouped together and are called\ndistributions. The probability that a system will exist with its components in a given distribution is\nproportional to the number of microstates within the distribution. Since entropy increases logarithmically\nwith the number of microstates, the most probable distribution is therefore the one of greatest entropy.\nFIGURE 16.8\nThe sixteen microstates associated with placing four particles in two boxes are shown. The\nmicrostates are collected into five distributions—(a), (b), (c), (d), and (e)—based on the numbers of particles in each\nbox.\nFor this system, the most probable configuration is one of the six microstates associated with distribution (c)\nwhere the particles are evenly distributed between the boxes, that is, a configuration of two particles in each\n788\n16 • Thermodynamics\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

A\nmacroscopic (laboratory-sized) system would typically consist of moles of particles (N ~ 1023), and the\ncorresponding number of microstates would be staggeringly huge. Regardless of the number of particles in the\nsystem, however, the distributions in which roughly equal numbers of particles are found in each box are\nalways the most probable configurations.\nThis matter dispersal model of entropy is often described qualitatively in terms of the disorder of the system.\nBy this description, microstates in which all the particles are in a single box are the most ordered, thus\npossessing the least entropy. Microstates in which the particles are more evenly distributed among the boxes\nare more disordered, possessing greater entropy.\nThe previous description of an ideal gas expanding into a vacuum (Figure 16.4) is a macroscopic example of\nthis particle-in-a-box model. For this system, the most probable distribution is confirmed to be the one in\nwhich the matter is most uniformly dispersed or distributed between the two flasks. Initially, the gas molecules\nare confined to just one of the two flasks. Opening the valve between the flasks increases the volume available\nto the gas molecules and, correspondingly, the number of microstates possible for the system. Since Wf > Wi,\nthe expansion process involves an increase in entropy (ΔS > 0) and is spontaneous.\nA similar approach may be used to describe the spontaneous flow of heat. Consider a system consisting of two\nobjects, each containing two particles, and two units of thermal energy (represented as “*”) in Figure 16.9. The\nhot object is comprised of particles A and B and initially contains both energy units. The cold object is\ncomprised of particles C and D, which initially has no energy units. Distribution (a) shows the three\nmicrostates possible for the initial state of the system, with both units of energy contained within the hot\nobject. If one of the two energy units is transferred, the result is distribution (b) consisting of four microstates.\nIf both energy units are transferred, the result is distribution (c) consisting of three microstates. Thus, we may\ndescribe this system by a total of ten microstates. The probability that the heat does not flow when the two\nobjects are brought into contact, that is, that the system remains in distribution (a), is\nMore likely is the\nflow of heat to yield one of the other two distribution, the combined probability being\nThe most likely result\nis the flow of heat to yield the uniform dispersal of energy represented by distribution (b), the probability of\nthis configuration being\nThis supports the common observation that placing hot and cold objects in\ncontact results in spontaneous heat flow that ultimately equalizes the objects’ temperatures. And, again, this\nspontaneous process is also characterized by an increase in system entropy.\nFIGURE 16.9\nThis shows a microstate model describing the flow of heat from a hot object to a cold object. (a)\nBefore the heat flow occurs, the object comprised of particles A and B contains both units of energy and as\nrepresented by a distribution of three microstates. (b) If the heat flow results in an even dispersal of energy (one\nenergy unit transferred), a distribution of four microstates results.

Processes that involve an increase in entropy of the system (ΔS > 0) are very often\nspontaneous; however, examples to the contrary are plentiful. By expanding consideration of entropy changes\nto include the surroundings, we may reach a significant conclusion regarding the relation between this\nproperty and spontaneity. In thermodynamic models, the system and surroundings comprise everything, that\nis, the universe, and so the following is true:\nTo illustrate this relation, consider again the process of heat flow between two objects, one identified as the\nsystem and the other as the surroundings. There are three possibilities for such a process:\n1.\nThe objects are at different temperatures, and heat flows from the hotter to the cooler object. This is\nalways observed to occur spontaneously. Designating the hotter object as the system and invoking the\ndefinition of entropy yields the following:\nThe magnitudes of −qrev and qrev are equal, their opposite arithmetic signs denoting loss of heat by the\nsystem and gain of heat by the surroundings. Since Tsys > Tsurr in this scenario, the entropy decrease of the\nsystem will be less than the entropy increase of the surroundings, and so the entropy of the universe will\nincrease:\n2.\nThe objects are at different temperatures, and heat flows from the cooler to the hotter object. This is never\nobserved to occur spontaneously. Again designating the hotter object as the system and invoking the\ndefinition of entropy yields the following:\nThe arithmetic signs of qrev denote the gain of heat by the system and the loss of heat by the surroundings.\nThe magnitude of the entropy change for the surroundings will again be greater than that for the system,\nbut in this case, the signs of the heat changes (that is, the direction of the heat flow) will yield a negative\nvalue for ΔSuniv. This process involves a decrease in the entropy of the universe.\n3.\nThe objects are at essentially the same temperature, Tsys ≈Tsurr, and so the magnitudes of the entropy\nchanges are essentially the same for both the system and the surroundings. In this case, the entropy\nchange of the universe is zero, and the system is at equilibrium.\nThese results lead to a profound statement regarding the relation between entropy and spontaneity known as\nthe second law of thermodynamics: all spontaneous changes cause an increase in the entropy of the\nuniverse.

With these contributions in mind, consider the entropy of a pure, perfectly crystalline\nsolid possessing no kinetic energy (that is, at a temperature of absolute zero, 0 K). This system may be\ndescribed by a single microstate, as its purity, perfect crystallinity and complete lack of motion means there is\nbut one possible location for each identical atom or molecule comprising the crystal (W = 1).

Although a rigorous treatment of this\nsubject is beyond the scope of an introductory chemistry text, a brief discussion is helpful for gaining a better\nperspective on this important thermodynamic property.\nFor this purpose, consider a spontaneous, exothermic process that involves a decrease in entropy. The free\nenergy, as defined by\nmay be interpreted as representing the difference between the energy produced by the process, ΔH, and the\nenergy lost to the surroundings, TΔS. The difference between the energy produced and the energy lost is the\nenergy available (or “free”) to do useful work by the process, ΔG. If the process somehow could be made to take\nplace under conditions of thermodynamic reversibility, the amount of work that could be done would be\nmaximal:\nHowever, as noted previously in this chapter, such conditions are not realistic. In addition, the technologies\nused to extract work from a spontaneous process (e.g., automobile engine, steam turbine) are never 100%\nefficient, and so the work done by these processes is always less than the theoretical maximum. Similar\nreasoning may be applied to a nonspontaneous process, for which the free energy change represents the\nminimum amount of work that must be done on the system to carry out the process.\nCalculating Free Energy Change\nFree energy is a state function, so its value depends only on the conditions of the initial and final states of the\nsystem. A convenient and common approach to the calculation of free energy changes for physical and\nchemical reactions is by use of widely available compilations of standard state thermodynamic data.

A spontaneous process occurs without\nthe need for a continual input of energy from some\nexternal source, while a nonspontaneous process\nrequires such. Systems undergoing a spontaneous\nprocess may or may not experience a gain or loss of\nenergy, but they will experience a change in the way\nmatter and/or energy is distributed within the\nsystem.\n16.2 Entropy\nEntropy (S) is a state function that can be related to\nthe number of microstates for a system (the number\nof ways the system can be arranged) and to the ratio\nof reversible heat to kelvin temperature. It may be\ninterpreted as a measure of the dispersal or\ndistribution of matter and/or energy in a system,\nand it is often described as representing the\n“disorder” of the system.\nFor a given substance, entropy depends on phase\nwith Ssolid < Sliquid < Sgas.

Readers wishing additional review are referred to the text chapter on reaction\nstoichiometry.\nOxidation Numbers\nBy definition, a redox reaction is one that entails changes in oxidation number (or oxidation state) for one or\nmore of the elements involved. The oxidation number of an element in a compound is essentially an\nassessment of how the electronic environment of its atoms is different in comparison to atoms of the pure\nelement. By this description, the oxidation number of an atom in an element is equal to zero. For an atom in a\ncompound, the oxidation number is equal to the charge the atom would have in the compound if the\ncompound were ionic. Consequential to these rules, the sum of oxidation numbers for all atoms in a molecule\nis equal to the charge on the molecule. To illustrate this formalism, examples from the two compound classes,\nionic and covalent, will be considered.\nSimple ionic compounds present the simplest examples to illustrate this formalism, since by definition the\nelements’ oxidation numbers are numerically equivalent to ionic charges. Sodium chloride, NaCl, is comprised\nof Na+ cations and Cl−anions, and so oxidation numbers for sodium and chlorine are, +1 and −1, respectively.\nCalcium fluoride, CaF2, is comprised of Ca2+ cations and F−anions, and so oxidation numbers for calcium and\nfluorine are, +2 and −1, respectively.\nCovalent compounds require a more challenging use of the formalism. Water is a covalent compound whose\nmolecules consist of two H atoms bonded separately to a central O atom via polar covalent O−H bonds. The\nshared electrons comprising an O−H bond are more strongly attracted to the more electronegative O atom, and\nso it acquires a partial negative charge in the water molecule (relative to an O atom in elemental oxygen).\nConsequently, H atoms in a water molecule exhibit partial positive charges compared to H atoms in elemental\nhydrogen. The sum of the partial negative and partial positive charges for each water molecule is zero, and the\nwater molecule is neutral.\nImagine that the polarization of shared electrons within the O−H bonds of water were 100% complete—the\nresult would be transfer of electrons from H to O, and water would be an ionic compound comprised of O2−\nanions and H+ cations. And so, the oxidations numbers for oxygen and hydrogen in water are −2 and +1,\nrespectively. Applying this same logic to carbon tetrachloride, CCl4, yields oxidation numbers of +4 for carbon\nand −1 for chlorine. In the nitrate ion,\n, the oxidation number for nitrogen is +5 and that for oxygen is −2,\nsumming to equal the 1− charge on the molecule:\nBalancing Redox Equations\nThe unbalanced equation below describes the decomposition of molten sodium chloride:\nThis reaction satisfies the criterion for redox classification, since the oxidation number for Na is decreased\nfrom +1 to 0 (it undergoes reduction) and that for Cl is increased from −1 to 0 (it undergoes oxidation). The\nequation in this case is easily balanced by inspection, requiring stoichiometric coefficients of 2 for the NaCl\nand Na:\n818\n17 • Electrochemistry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

A gradual but visually impressive change spontaneously\noccurs as the initially colorless solution becomes increasingly blue, and the initially smooth copper wire\nbecomes covered with a porous gray solid.\nFIGURE 17.2\nA copper wire and an aqueous solution of silver nitrate (left) are brought into contact (center) and a\nspontaneous transfer of electrons occurs, creating blue Cu2+(aq) and gray Ag(s) (right).\nThese observations are consistent with (i) the oxidation of elemental copper to yield copper(II) ions, Cu2+(aq),\nwhich impart a blue color to the solution, and (ii) the reduction of silver(I) ions to yield elemental silver, which\ndeposits as a fluffy solid on the copper wire surface. And so, the direct transfer of electrons from the copper\nwire to the aqueous silver ions is spontaneous under the employed conditions. A summary of this redox\nsystem is provided by these equations:\nConsider the construction of a device that contains all the reactants and products of a redox system like the\none here, but prevents physical contact between the reactants. Direct transfer of electrons is, therefore,\nprevented; transfer, instead, takes place indirectly through an external circuit that contacts the separated\nreactants. Devices of this sort are generally referred to as electrochemical cells, and those in which a\nspontaneous redox reaction takes place are called galvanic cells (or voltaic cells).\nA galvanic cell based on the spontaneous reaction between copper and silver(I) is depicted in Figure 17.3. The\ncell is comprised of two half-cells, each containing the redox conjugate pair (“couple”) of a single reactant. The\nhalf-cell shown at the left contains the Cu(0)/Cu(II) couple in the form of a solid copper foil and an aqueous\nsolution of copper nitrate. The right half-cell contains the Ag(I)/Ag(0) couple as solid silver foil and an aqueous\nsilver nitrate solution. An external circuit is connected to each half-cell at its solid foil, meaning the Cu and Ag\nfoil each function as an electrode. By definition, the anode of an electrochemical cell is the electrode at which\noxidation occurs (in this case, the Cu foil) and the cathode is the electrode where reduction occurs (the Ag foil).\nThe redox reactions in a galvanic cell occur only at the interface between each half-cell’s reaction mixture and\nits electrode. To keep the reactants separate while maintaining charge-balance, the two half-cell solutions are\nconnected by a tube filled with inert electrolyte solution called a salt bridge. The spontaneous reaction in this\ncell produces Cu2+ cations in the anode half-cell and consumes Ag+ ions in the cathode half-cell, resulting in a\ncompensatory flow of inert ions from the salt bridge that maintains charge balance. Increasing concentrations\nof Cu2+ in the anode half-cell are balanced by an influx of NO3−from the salt bridge, while a flow of Na+ into the\ncathode half-cell compensates for the decreasing Ag+ concentration.\n17.2 • Galvanic Cells\n821",

Electrochemical cells permit this relative redox activity to be quantified by an\neasily measured property, potential. This property is more commonly called voltage when referenced in regard\nto electrical applications, and it is a measure of energy accompanying the transfer of charge. Potentials are\nmeasured in the volt unit, defined as one joule of energy per one coulomb of charge, V = J/C.\nWhen measured for purposes of electrochemistry, a potential reflects the driving force for a specific type of\ncharge transfer process, namely, the transfer of electrons between redox reactants. Considering the nature of\npotential in this context, it is clear that the potential of a single half-cell or a single electrode can’t be\nmeasured; “transfer” of electrons requires both a donor and recipient, in this case a reductant and an oxidant,\nrespectively.

Predictions regarding the\nspontaneity of redox reactions under standard state conditions can then be easily made by simply comparing\nthe relative positions of their table entries. By definition, E°cell is positive when E°cathode > E°anode, and so any\nredox reaction in which the oxidant’s entry is above the reductant’s entry is predicted to be spontaneous.\nReconsideration of the two redox reactions in Example 17.4 provides support for this fact. The entry for the\nsilver(I)/silver(0) half-reaction is above that for the copper(II)/copper(0) half-reaction, and so the oxidation of\nCu by Ag+ is predicted to be spontaneous (E°cathode > E°anode and so E°cell > 0).

The total cost of corrosion remediation in the United States is significant, with\nestimates in excess of half a trillion dollars a year.\nChemistry in Everyday Life\nStatue of Liberty: Changing Colors\nThe Statue of Liberty is a landmark every American recognizes. The Statue of Liberty is easily identified by\nits height, stance, and unique blue-green color (Figure 17.15). When this statue was first delivered from\nFrance, its appearance was not green. It was brown, the color of its copper “skin.” So how did the Statue of\nLiberty change colors? The change in appearance was a direct result of corrosion. The copper that is the\nprimary component of the statue slowly underwent oxidation from the air. The oxidation-reduction\nreactions of copper metal in the environment occur in several steps. Copper metal is oxidized to copper(I)\noxide (Cu2O), which is red, and then to copper(II) oxide, which is black\nCoal, which was often high in sulfur, was burned extensively in the early part of the last century. As a result,\natmospheric sulfur trioxide, carbon dioxide, and water all reacted with the CuO\nThese three compounds are responsible for the characteristic blue-green patina seen on the Statue of\nLiberty (and other outdoor copper structures). Fortunately, formation of patina creates a protective layer\non the copper surface, preventing further corrosion of the underlying copper. The formation of the\nprotective layer is called passivation, a phenomenon discussed further in another chapter of this text.\n840\n17 • Electrochemistry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

A galvanic cell results that may be approximated by the simplified cell schematic Fe(s) | Fe2+(aq)\n||O2(aq), H2O(l) | Fe(s).\nOne way to keep iron from corroding is to keep it painted. The layer of paint prevents the water and oxygen\nnecessary for rust formation from coming into contact with the iron. As long as the paint remains intact, the\niron is protected from corrosion.\nOther strategies include alloying the iron with other metals. For example, stainless steel is an alloy of iron\ncontaining a small amount of chromium. The chromium tends to collect near the surface, where it corrodes\nand forms a passivating an oxide layer that protects the iron.\nIron and other metals may also be protected from corrosion by galvanization, a process in which the metal to\nbe protected is coated with a layer of a more readily oxidized metal, usually zinc. When the zinc layer is intact,\nit prevents air from contacting the underlying iron and thus prevents corrosion. If the zinc layer is breached by\neither corrosion or mechanical abrasion, the iron may still be protected from corrosion by a cathodic\nprotection process, which is described in the next paragraph.\nAnother important way to protect metal is to make it the cathode in a galvanic cell. This is cathodic protection\nand can be used for metals other than just iron. For example, the rusting of underground iron storage tanks\nand pipes can be prevented or greatly reduced by connecting them to a more active metal such as zinc or\nmagnesium (Figure 17.17). This is also used to protect the metal parts in water heaters. The more active\nmetals (lower reduction potential) are called sacrificial anodes because as they get used up as they corrode\n(oxidize) at the anode. The metal being protected serves as the cathode for the reduction of oxygen in air, and\nso it simply serves to conduct (not react with) the electrons being transferred.

The half-reaction method is a systematic\napproach to balancing such equations that involves\nseparate treatment of the oxidation and reduction\nhalf-reactions.\n17.2 Galvanic Cells\nGalvanic cells are devices in which a spontaneous\nredox reaction occurs indirectly, with the oxidant\nand reductant redox couples contained in separate\nhalf-cells. Electrons are transferred from the\nreductant (in the anode half-cell) to the oxidant (in\nthe cathode half-cell) through an external circuit,\nand inert solution phase ions are transferred\nbetween half-cells, through a salt bridge, to maintain\ncharge neutrality. The construction and composition\nof a galvanic cell may be succinctly represented\nusing chemical formulas and others symbols in the\nform of a cell schematic (cell notation).\n17.3 Electrode and Cell Potentials\nThe property of potential, E, is the energy associated\nwith the separation/transfer of charge. In\nelectrochemistry, the potentials of cells and half-\ncells are thermodynamic quantities that reflect the\ndriving force or the spontaneity of their redox\nprocesses. The cell potential of an electrochemical\ncell is the difference in between its cathode and\nanode. To permit easy sharing of half-cell potential\ndata, the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) is\nassigned a potential of exactly 0 V and used to define\na single electrode potential for any given half-cell.\nThe electrode potential of a half-cell, EX, is the cell\npotential of said half-cell acting as a cathode when\nconnected to a SHE acting as an anode. When the\nhalf-cell is operating under standard state\nconditions, its potential is the standard electrode\npotential, E°X. Standard electrode potentials reflect\nthe relative oxidizing strength of the half-reaction’s\nreactant, with stronger oxidants exhibiting larger\n(more positive) E°X values. Tabulations of standard\nelectrode potentials may be used to compute\nstandard cell potentials, E°cell, for many redox\nreactions. The arithmetic sign of a cell potential\nindicates the spontaneity of the cell reaction, with\npositive values for spontaneous reactions and\nnegative values for nonspontaneous reactions\n(spontaneous in the reverse direction).\n17.4 Potential, Free Energy, and Equilibrium\nPotential is a thermodynamic quantity reflecting the\nintrinsic driving force of a redox process, and it is\ndirectly related to the free energy change and\nequilibrium constant for the process. For redox\nprocesses taking place in electrochemical cells, the\nmaximum (electrical) work done by the system is\neasily computed from the cell potential and the\nreaction stoichiometry and is equal to the free\nenergy change for the process. The equilibrium\nconstant for a redox reaction is logarithmically\nrelated to the reaction’s cell potential, with larger\n(more positive) potentials indicating reactions with\ngreater driving force that equilibrate when the\nreaction has proceeded far towards completion\n(large value of K).

Fuel cells\nare typically much more efficient in converting the\nenergy released by the reaction to useful work in\ncomparison to internal combustion engines.\n17.6 Corrosion\nSpontaneous oxidation of metals by natural\nelectrochemical processes is called corrosion,\nfamiliar examples including the rusting of iron and\nthe tarnishing of silver. Corrosion process involve\nthe creation of a galvanic cell in which different sites\non the metal object function as anode and cathode,\nwith the corrosion taking place at the anodic site.\nApproaches to preventing corrosion of metals\ninclude use of a protective coating of zinc\n(galvanization) and the use of sacrificial anodes\nconnected to the metal object (cathodic protection).\n17.7 Electrolysis\nNonspontaneous redox processes may be forced to\noccur in electrochemical cells by the application of\nan appropriate potential using an external power\nsource—a process known as electrolysis. Electrolysis\nis the basis for certain ore refining processes, the\nindustrial production of many chemical\ncommodities, and the electroplating of metal\ncoatings on various products. Measurement of the\ncurrent flow during electrolysis permits\nstoichiometric calculations.\nExercises\n17.1 Review of Redox Chemistry\n1.

The primary focus of this section will be the application of periodicity to the representative\nmetals.\nIt is possible to divide elements into groups according to their electron configurations. The representative\nelements are elements where the s and p orbitals are filling. The transition elements are elements where the d\norbitals (groups 3–11 on the periodic table) are filling, and the inner transition metals are the elements where\nthe f orbitals are filling. The d orbitals fill with the elements in group 11; therefore, the elements in group 12\nqualify as representative elements because the last electron enters an s orbital. Metals among the\nrepresentative elements are the representative metals. Metallic character results from an element’s ability to\nlose its outer valence electrons and results in high thermal and electrical conductivity, among other physical\nand chemical properties. There are 20 nonradioactive representative metals in groups 1, 2, 3, 12, 13, 14, and\n15 of the periodic table (the elements shaded in yellow in Figure 18.2). The radioactive elements copernicium,\nflerovium, polonium, and livermorium are also metals but are beyond the scope of this chapter.\nIn addition to the representative metals, some of the representative elements are metalloids. A metalloid is an\nelement that has properties that are between those of metals and nonmetals; these elements are typically\nsemiconductors.\nThe remaining representative elements are nonmetals. Unlike metals, which typically form cations and ionic\ncompounds (containing ionic bonds), nonmetals tend to form anions or molecular compounds. In general, the\ncombination of a metal and a nonmetal produces a salt. A salt is an ionic compound consisting of cations and\nanions.\n858\n18 • Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Nonmetals are shown in\ngreen, metalloids in purple, and the transition metals and inner transition metals in blue.\nMost of the representative metals do not occur naturally in an uncombined state because they readily react\nwith water and oxygen in the air. However, it is possible to isolate elemental beryllium, magnesium, zinc,\ncadmium, mercury, aluminum, tin, and lead from their naturally occurring minerals and use them because\nthey react very slowly with air. Part of the reason why these elements react slowly is that these elements react\nwith air to form a protective coating. The formation of this protective coating is passivation. The coating is a\nnonreactive film of oxide or some other compound. Elemental magnesium, aluminum, zinc, and tin are\nimportant in the fabrication of many familiar items, including wire, cookware, foil, and many household and\npersonal objects. Although beryllium, cadmium, mercury, and lead are readily available, there are limitations\nin their use because of their toxicity.\nGroup 1: The Alkali Metals\nThe alkali metals lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, and francium constitute group 1 of the\nperiodic table. Although hydrogen is in group 1 (and also in group 17), it is a nonmetal and deserves separate\nconsideration later in this chapter. The name alkali metal is in reference to the fact that these metals and their\noxides react with water to form very basic (alkaline) solutions.\nThe properties of the alkali metals are similar to each other as expected for elements in the same family. The\nalkali metals have the largest atomic radii and the lowest first ionization energy in their periods. This\ncombination makes it very easy to remove the single electron in the outermost (valence) shell of each. The easy\nloss of this valence electron means that these metals readily form stable cations with a charge of 1+. Their\n18.1 • Periodicity\n859",

Since oxidation is so easy, the reverse, reduction, is difficult, which explains\nwhy it is hard to isolate the elements. The solid alkali metals are very soft; lithium, shown in Figure 18.3, has\nthe lowest density of any metal (0.5 g/cm3).\nThe alkali metals all react vigorously with water to form hydrogen gas and a basic solution of the metal\nhydroxide. This means they are easier to oxidize than is hydrogen. As an example, the reaction of lithium with\nwater is:\nFIGURE 18.3\nLithium floats in paraffin oil because its density is less than the density of paraffin oil.\nAlkali metals react directly with all the nonmetals (except the noble gases) to yield binary ionic compounds\ncontaining 1+ metal ions. These metals are so reactive that it is necessary to avoid contact with both moisture\nand oxygen in the air. Therefore, they are stored in sealed containers under mineral oil, as shown in Figure\n18.4, to prevent contact with air and moisture. The pure metals never exist free (uncombined) in nature due to\ntheir high reactivity. In addition, this high reactivity makes it necessary to prepare the metals by electrolysis of\nalkali metal compounds.\nFIGURE 18.4\nTo prevent contact with air and water, potassium for laboratory use comes as sticks or beads stored\nunder kerosene or mineral oil, or in sealed containers. (credit: http://images-of-elements.com/potassium.php)\nUnlike many other metals, the reactivity and softness of the alkali metals make these metals unsuitable for\nstructural applications. However, there are applications where the reactivity of the alkali metals is an\nadvantage.

Streetlights sometime employ sodium vapor\nlights because the sodium vapor penetrates fog better than most other light. This is because the fog does not\nscatter yellow light as much as it scatters white light. The other alkali metals and their salts also impart color to\na flame.

The name alkaline metal comes from the fact that the oxides of the heavier members of\nthe group react with water to form alkaline solutions. The nuclear charge increases when going from group 1\nto group 2. Because of this charge increase, the atoms of the alkaline earth metals are smaller and have higher\nfirst ionization energies than the alkali metals within the same period. The higher ionization energy makes the\nalkaline earth metals less reactive than the alkali metals; however, they are still very reactive elements. Their\nreactivity increases, as expected, with increasing size and decreasing ionization energy. In chemical reactions,\nthese metals readily lose both valence electrons to form compounds in which they exhibit an oxidation state of\n2+. Due to their high reactivity, it is common to produce the alkaline earth metals, like the alkali metals, by\n18.1 • Periodicity\n861",

Even though the ionization energies are low, the two metals with the highest ionization energies\n(beryllium and magnesium) do form compounds that exhibit some covalent characters. Like the alkali metals,\nthe heavier alkaline earth metals impart color to a flame. As in the case of the alkali metals, this is part of the\nemission spectrum of these elements. Calcium and strontium produce shades of red, whereas barium\nproduces a green color.\nMagnesium is a silver-white metal that is malleable and ductile at high temperatures. Passivation decreases\nthe reactivity of magnesium metal. Upon exposure to air, a tightly adhering layer of magnesium oxycarbonate\nforms on the surface of the metal and inhibits further reaction. (The carbonate comes from the reaction of\ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere.) Magnesium is the lightest of the widely used structural metals, which is\nwhy most magnesium production is for lightweight alloys.\nMagnesium (shown in Figure 18.6), calcium, strontium, and barium react with water and air. At room\ntemperature, barium shows the most vigorous reaction. The products of the reaction with water are hydrogen\nand the metal hydroxide. The formation of hydrogen gas indicates that the heavier alkaline earth metals are\nbetter reducing agents (more easily oxidized) than is hydrogen. As expected, these metals react with both acids\nand nonmetals to form ionic compounds. Unlike most salts of the alkali metals, many of the common salts of\nthe alkaline earth metals are insoluble in water because of the high lattice energies of these compounds,\ncontaining a divalent metal ion.\nFIGURE 18.6\nFrom left to right: Mg(s), warm water at pH 7, and the resulting solution with a pH greater than 7, as\nindicated by the pink color of the phenolphthalein indicator. (credit: modification of work by Sahar Atwa)\nThe potent reducing power of hot magnesium is useful in preparing some metals from their oxides. Indeed,\nmagnesium’s affinity for oxygen is so great that burning magnesium reacts with carbon dioxide, producing\nelemental carbon:\nFor this reason, a CO2 fire extinguisher will not extinguish a magnesium fire. Additionally, the brilliant white\nlight emitted by burning magnesium makes it useful in flares and fireworks.\nGroup 12\nThe elements in group 12 are transition elements; however, the last electron added is not a d electron, but an s\nelectron. Since the last electron added is an s electron, these elements qualify as representative metals, or\npost-transition metals. The group 12 elements behave more like the alkaline earth metals than transition\nmetals. Group 12 contains the four elements zinc, cadmium, mercury, and copernicium. Each of these\nelements has two electrons in its outer shell (ns2). When atoms of these metals form cations with a charge of\n2+, where the two outer electrons are lost, they have pseudo-noble gas electron configurations. Mercury is\nsometimes an exception because it also exhibits an oxidation state of 1+ in compounds that contain a diatomic\nion. In their elemental forms and in compounds, cadmium and mercury are both toxic.\nZinc is the most reactive in group 12, and mercury is the least reactive.

The increase in reactivity\nwith increasing atomic number only occurs for the metals in groups 1 and 2.) The decreasing reactivity is due\nto the formation of ions with a pseudo-noble gas configuration and to other factors that are beyond the scope of\nthis discussion. The chemical behaviors of zinc and cadmium are quite similar to each other but differ from\nthat of mercury.\nZinc and cadmium have lower reduction potentials than hydrogen, and, like the alkali metals and alkaline\nearth metals, they will produce hydrogen gas when they react with acids. The reaction of zinc with\nhydrochloric acid, shown in Figure 18.7, is:\nFIGURE 18.7\nZinc is an active metal. It dissolves in hydrochloric acid, forming a solution of colorless Zn2+ ions, Cl–\nions, and hydrogen gas.\nZinc is a silvery metal that quickly tarnishes to a blue-gray appearance. This change in color is due to an\nadherent coating of a basic carbonate, Zn2(OH)2CO3, which passivates the metal to inhibit further corrosion.\nDry cell and alkaline batteries contain a zinc anode. Brass (Cu and Zn) and some bronze (Cu, Sn, and\nsometimes Zn) are important zinc alloys. About half of zinc production serves to protect iron and other metals\nfrom corrosion. This protection may take the form of a sacrificial anode (also known as a galvanic anode, which\nis a means of providing cathodic protection for various metals) or as a thin coating on the protected metal.\nGalvanized steel is steel with a protective coating of zinc.\nChemistry in Everyday Life\nSacrificial Anodes\nA sacrificial anode, or galvanic anode, is a means of providing cathodic protection of various metals.\nCathodic protection refers to the prevention of corrosion by converting the corroding metal into a cathode.\nAs a cathode, the metal resists corrosion, which is an oxidation process. Corrosion occurs at the sacrificial\nanode instead of at the cathode.\nThe construction of such a system begins with the attachment of a more active metal (more negative\nreduction potential) to the metal needing protection. Attachment may be direct or via a wire. To complete\nthe circuit, a salt bridge is necessary. This salt bridge is often seawater or ground water. Once the circuit is\ncomplete, oxidation (corrosion) occurs at the anode and not the cathode.\nThe commonly used sacrificial anodes are magnesium, aluminum, and zinc. Magnesium has the most\nnegative reduction potential of the three and serves best when the salt bridge is less efficient due to a low\nelectrolyte concentration such as in freshwater. Zinc and aluminum work better in saltwater than does\nmagnesium. Aluminum is lighter than zinc and has a higher capacity; however, an oxide coating may\npassivate the aluminum. In special cases, other materials are useful. For example, iron will protect copper.\n18.1 • Periodicity\n863",

Thus, it does not displace hydrogen from acids; however, it will react\nwith strong oxidizing acids, such as nitric acid:\nThe clear NO initially formed quickly undergoes further oxidation to the reddish brown NO2.\nFIGURE 18.8\nFrom left to right: Hg(l), Hg + concentrated HCl, Hg + concentrated HNO3. (credit: Sahar Atwa)\nMost mercury compounds decompose when heated. Most mercury compounds contain mercury with a 2+-\noxidation state. When there is a large excess of mercury, it is possible to form compounds containing the\nion. All mercury compounds are toxic, and it is necessary to exercise great care in their synthesis.\nChemistry in Everyday Life\nAmalgams\nAn amalgam is an alloy of mercury with one or more other metals. This is similar to considering steel to be\nan alloy of iron with other metals. Most metals will form an amalgam with mercury, with the main\nexceptions being iron, platinum, tungsten, and tantalum.\nDue to toxicity issues with mercury, there has been a significant decrease in the use of amalgams.\nHistorically, amalgams were important in electrolytic cells and in the extraction of gold. Amalgams of the\nalkali metals still find use because they are strong reducing agents and easier to handle than the pure alkali\nmetals.\nProspectors had a problem when they found finely divided gold. They learned that adding mercury to their\npans collected the gold into the mercury to form an amalgam for easier collection. Unfortunately, losses of\nsmall amounts of mercury over the years left many streams in California polluted with mercury.\nDentists use amalgams containing silver and other metals to fill cavities. There are several reasons to use\nan amalgam including low cost, ease of manipulation, and longevity compared to alternate materials.\nDental amalgams are approximately 50% mercury by weight, which, in recent years, has become a concern\ndue to the toxicity of mercury.\nAfter reviewing the best available data, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers amalgam-based\nfillings to be safe for adults and children over six years of age. Even with multiple fillings, the mercury\nlevels in the patients remain far below the lowest levels associated with harm. Clinical studies have found\nno link between dental amalgams and health problems.

The lightest\nelement, boron, is semiconducting, and its binary compounds tend to be covalent and not ionic. The\nremaining elements of the group are metals, but their oxides and hydroxides change characters. The oxides\nand hydroxides of aluminum and gallium exhibit both acidic and basic behaviors. A substance, such as these\ntwo, that will react with both acids and bases is amphoteric. This characteristic illustrates the combination of\nnonmetallic and metallic behaviors of these two elements. Indium and thallium oxides and hydroxides exhibit\nonly basic behavior, in accordance with the clearly metallic character of these two elements. The melting point\nof gallium is unusually low (about 30 °C) and will melt in your hand.\nAluminum is amphoteric because it will react with both acids and bases. A typical reaction with an acid is:\nThe products of the reaction of aluminum with a base depend upon the reaction conditions, with the following\nbeing one possibility:\nWith both acids and bases, the reaction with aluminum generates hydrogen gas.\nThe group 13 elements have a valence shell electron configuration of ns2np1. Aluminum normally uses all of\nits valence electrons when it reacts, giving compounds in which it has an oxidation state of 3+. Although many\nof these compounds are covalent, others, such as AlF3 and Al2(SO4)3, are ionic. Aqueous solutions of aluminum\nsalts contain the cation\nabbreviated as Al3+(aq). Gallium, indium, and thallium also form ionic\ncompounds containing M3+ ions. These three elements exhibit not only the expected oxidation state of 3+ from\nthe three valence electrons but also an oxidation state (in this case, 1+) that is two below the expected value.\nThis phenomenon, the inert pair effect, refers to the formation of a stable ion with an oxidation state two lower\nthan expected for the group. The pair of electrons is the valence s orbital for those elements. In general, the\ninert pair effect is important for the lower p-block elements. In an aqueous solution, the Tl+(aq) ion is more\nstable than is Tl3+(aq). In general, these metals will react with air and water to form 3+ ions; however, thallium\nreacts to give thallium(I) derivatives. The metals of group 13 all react directly with nonmetals such as sulfur,\nphosphorus, and the halogens, forming binary compounds.\nThe metals of group 13 (Al, Ga, In, and Tl) are all reactive. However, passivation occurs as a tough, hard, thin\nfilm of the metal oxide forms upon exposure to air. Disruption of this film may counter the passivation,\nallowing the metal to react. One way to disrupt the film is to expose the passivated metal to mercury. Some of\nthe metal dissolves in the mercury to form an amalgam, which sheds the protective oxide layer to expose the\nmetal to further reaction. The formation of an amalgam allows the metal to react with air and water.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nAlthough easily oxidized, the passivation of aluminum makes it very useful as a strong, lightweight building\nmaterial. Because of the formation of an amalgam, mercury is corrosive to structural materials made of\naluminum. This video (http://openstax.org/l/16aluminumhg) demonstrates how the integrity of an aluminum\nbeam can be destroyed by the addition of a small amount of elemental mercury.\nThe most important uses of aluminum are in the construction and transportation industries, and in the\nmanufacture of aluminum cans and aluminum foil. These uses depend on the lightness, toughness, and\nstrength of the metal, as well as its resistance to corrosion. Because aluminum is an excellent conductor of\nheat and resists corrosion, it is useful in the manufacture of cooking utensils.\nchildren under six or pregnant women. The FDA conclusions are in line with the opinions of the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The only health\nconsideration noted is that some people are allergic to the amalgam or one of its components.\n18.1 • Periodicity\n865",

Although more expensive than reduction by carbon, aluminum is important in the\nisolation of Mo, W, and Cr from their oxides.\nGroup 14\nThe metallic members of group 14 are tin, lead, and flerovium. Carbon is a typical nonmetal. The remaining\nelements of the group, silicon and germanium, are examples of semimetals or metalloids. Tin and lead form\nthe stable divalent cations, Sn2+ and Pb2+, with oxidation states two below the group oxidation state of 4+. The\nstability of this oxidation state is a consequence of the inert pair effect. Tin and lead also form covalent\ncompounds with a formal 4+-oxidation state. For example, SnCl4 and PbCl4 are low-boiling covalent liquids.\nFIGURE 18.9\n(a) Tin(II) chloride is an ionic solid; (b) tin(IV) chloride is a covalent liquid.\nTin reacts readily with nonmetals and acids to form tin(II) compounds (indicating that it is more easily\noxidized than hydrogen) and with nonmetals to form either tin(II) or tin(IV) compounds (shown in Figure 18.9),\ndepending on the stoichiometry and reaction conditions. Lead is less reactive. It is only slightly easier to\noxidize than hydrogen, and oxidation normally requires a hot concentrated acid.\nMany of these elements exist as allotropes. Allotropes are two or more forms of the same element in the same\nphysical state with different chemical and physical properties. There are two common allotropes of tin. These\nallotropes are grey (brittle) tin and white tin. As with other allotropes, the difference between these forms of tin\nis in the arrangement of the atoms. White tin is stable above 13.2 °C and is malleable like other metals. At low\ntemperatures, gray tin is the more stable form. Gray tin is brittle and tends to break down to a powder.\nConsequently, articles made of tin will disintegrate in cold weather, particularly if the cold spell is lengthy. The\nchange progresses slowly from the spot of origin, and the gray tin that is first formed catalyzes further change.\nIn a way, this effect is similar to the spread of an infection in a plant or animal body, leading people to call this\nprocess tin disease or tin pest.\nThe principal use of tin is in the coating of steel to form tin plate-sheet iron, which constitutes the tin in tin\ncans. Important tin alloys are bronze (Cu and Sn) and solder (Sn and Pb). Lead is important in the lead storage\nbatteries in automobiles.\nGroup 15\nBismuth, the heaviest member of group 15, is a less reactive metal than the other representative metals. It\nreadily gives up three of its five valence electrons to active nonmetals to form the tri-positive ion, Bi3+. It forms\ncompounds with the group oxidation state of 5+ only when treated with strong oxidizing agents. The stability of\nthe 3+-oxidation state is another example of the inert pair effect.\n866\n18 • Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

However,\ncompounds that contain ions of most representative metals are abundant. In this section, we will consider the\ntwo common techniques used to isolate the metals from these compounds—electrolysis and chemical\nreduction.\nThese metals primarily occur in minerals, with lithium found in silicate or phosphate minerals, and sodium\nand potassium found in salt deposits from evaporation of ancient seas and in silicates. The alkaline earth\nmetals occur as silicates and, with the exception of beryllium, as carbonates and sulfates. Beryllium occurs as\nthe mineral beryl, Be3Al2Si6O18, which, with certain impurities, may be either the gemstone emerald or\naquamarine. Magnesium is in seawater and, along with the heavier alkaline earth metals, occurs as silicates,\ncarbonates, and sulfates. Aluminum occurs abundantly in many types of clay and in bauxite, an impure\naluminum oxide hydroxide. The principle tin ore is the oxide cassiterite, SnO2, and the principle lead and\nthallium ores are the sulfides or the products of weathering of the sulfides. The remaining representative\nmetals occur as impurities in zinc or aluminum ores.\nElectrolysis\nIons of metals in of groups 1 and 2, along with aluminum, are very difficult to reduce; therefore, it is necessary\nto prepare these elements by electrolysis, an important process discussed in the chapter on electrochemistry.\nBriefly, electrolysis involves using electrical energy to drive unfavorable chemical reactions to completion; it is\nuseful in the isolation of reactive metals in their pure forms. Sodium, aluminum, and magnesium are typical\nexamples.\nThe Preparation of Sodium\nThe most important method for the production of sodium is the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride; the\nset-up is a Downs cell, shown in Figure 18.10. The reaction involved in this process is:\nThe electrolysis cell contains molten sodium chloride (melting point 801 °C), to which calcium chloride has\nbeen added to lower the melting point to 600 °C (a colligative effect). The passage of a direct current through\nthe cell causes the sodium ions to migrate to the negatively charged cathode and pick up electrons, reducing\nthe ions to sodium metal. Chloride ions migrate to the positively charged anode, lose electrons, and undergo\noxidation to chlorine gas. The overall cell reaction comes from adding the following reactions:\nSeparation of the molten sodium and chlorine prevents recombination. The liquid sodium, which is less dense\nthan molten sodium chloride, floats to the surface and flows into a collector. The gaseous chlorine goes to\nstorage tanks. Chlorine is also a valuable product.\n18.2 • Occurrence and Preparation of the Representative Metals\n867",

It is not\npossible to isolate sodium by electrolysis of aqueous solutions of sodium salts because hydrogen ions are more\neasily reduced than are sodium ions; as a result, hydrogen gas forms at the cathode instead of the desired sodium\nmetal. The high temperature required to melt NaCl means that liquid sodium metal forms.\nThe Preparation of Aluminum\nThe preparation of aluminum utilizes a process invented in 1886 by Charles M. Hall, who began to work on the\nproblem while a student at Oberlin College in Ohio. Paul L. T. Héroult discovered the process independently a\nmonth or two later in France. In honor to the two inventors, this electrolysis cell is known as the Hall–Héroult\ncell. The Hall–Héroult cell is an electrolysis cell for the production of aluminum. Figure 18.11 illustrates the\nHall–Héroult cell.\nThe production of aluminum begins with the purification of bauxite, the most common source of aluminum.\nThe reaction of bauxite, AlO(OH), with hot sodium hydroxide forms soluble sodium aluminate, while clay and\nother impurities remain undissolved:\nAfter the removal of the impurities by filtration, the addition of acid to the aluminate leads to the\nreprecipitation of aluminum hydroxide:\nThe next step is to remove the precipitated aluminum hydroxide by filtration. Heating the hydroxide produces\naluminum oxide, Al2O3, which dissolves in a molten mixture of cryolite, Na3AlF6, and calcium fluoride, CaF2.\nElectrolysis of this solution takes place in a cell like that shown in Figure 18.11. Reduction of aluminum ions to\nthe metal occurs at the cathode, while oxygen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide form at the anode.\n868\n18 • Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Seawater, which contains\napproximately 0.5% magnesium chloride, serves as the major source of magnesium. Addition of calcium\nhydroxide to seawater precipitates magnesium hydroxide. The addition of hydrochloric acid to magnesium\nhydroxide, followed by evaporation of the resultant aqueous solution, leaves pure magnesium chloride. The\nelectrolysis of molten magnesium chloride forms liquid magnesium and chlorine gas:\nSome production facilities have moved away from electrolysis completely. In the next section, we will see how\nthe Pidgeon process leads to the chemical reduction of magnesium.\nChemical Reduction\nIt is possible to isolate many of the representative metals by chemical reduction using other elements as\nreducing agents. In general, chemical reduction is much less expensive than electrolysis, and for this reason,\nchemical reduction is the method of choice for the isolation of these elements. For example, it is possible to\nproduce potassium, rubidium, and cesium by chemical reduction, as it is possible to reduce the molten\nchlorides of these metals with sodium metal. This may be surprising given that these metals are more reactive\nthan sodium; however, the metals formed are more volatile than sodium and can be distilled for collection. The\nremoval of the metal vapor leads to a shift in the equilibrium to produce more metal (see how reactions can be\ndriven in the discussions of Le Châtelier’s principle in the chapter on fundamental equilibrium concepts).\nThe production of magnesium, zinc, and tin provide additional examples of chemical reduction.\n18.2 • Occurrence and Preparation of the Representative Metals\n869",

Over\n75% of the world’s production of magnesium, primarily in China, comes from this process.\nThe Preparation of Zinc\nZinc ores usually contain zinc sulfide, zinc oxide, or zinc carbonate. After separation of these compounds from\nthe ores, heating in air converts the ore to zinc oxide by one of the following reactions:\nCarbon, in the form of coal, reduces the zinc oxide to form zinc vapor:\nThe zinc can be distilled (boiling point 907 °C) and condensed. This zinc contains impurities of cadmium (767\n°C), iron (2862 °C), lead (1750 °C), and arsenic (613 °C). Careful redistillation produces pure zinc. Arsenic and\ncadmium are distilled from the zinc because they have lower boiling points. At higher temperatures, the zinc is\ndistilled from the other impurities, mainly lead and iron.\nThe Preparation of Tin\nThe ready reduction of tin(IV) oxide by the hot coals of a campfire accounts for the knowledge of tin in the\nancient world. In the modern process, the roasting of tin ores containing SnO2 removes contaminants such as\narsenic and sulfur as volatile oxides. Treatment of the remaining material with hydrochloric acid removes the\noxides of other metals. Heating the purified ore with carbon at temperature above 1000 °C produces tin:\nThe molten tin collects at the bottom of the furnace and is drawn off and cast into blocks.\n18.3 Structure and General Properties of the Metalloids\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the general preparation, properties, and uses of the metalloids\n•\nDescribe the preparation, properties, and compounds of boron and silicon\nA series of six elements called the metalloids separate the metals from the nonmetals in the periodic table. The\nmetalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium. These elements look metallic;\nhowever, they do not conduct electricity as well as metals so they are semiconductors. They are\nsemiconductors because their electrons are more tightly bound to their nuclei than are those of metallic\nconductors. Their chemical behavior falls between that of metals and nonmetals. For example, the pure\nmetalloids form covalent crystals like the nonmetals, but like the metals, they generally do not form\nmonatomic anions. This intermediate behavior is in part due to their intermediate electronegativity values. In\nthis section, we will briefly discuss the chemical behavior of metalloids and deal with two of these\nelements—boron and silicon—in more detail.\nThe metalloid boron exhibits many similarities to its neighbor carbon and its diagonal neighbor silicon. All\nthree elements form covalent compounds. However, boron has one distinct difference in that its 2s22p1 outer\nelectron structure gives it one less valence electron than it has valence orbitals. Although boron exhibits an\noxidation state of 3+ in most of its stable compounds, this electron deficiency provides boron with the ability to\nform other, sometimes fractional, oxidation states, which occur, for example, in the boron hydrides.\n870\n18 • Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

The major differences between the chemistry of\ncarbon and silicon result from the relative strength of the carbon-carbon bond, carbon’s ability to form stable\nbonds to itself, and the presence of the empty 3d valence-shell orbitals in silicon. Silicon’s empty d orbitals and\nboron’s empty p orbital enable tetrahedral silicon compounds and trigonal planar boron compounds to act as\nLewis acids. Carbon, on the other hand, has no available valence shell orbitals; tetrahedral carbon compounds\ncannot act as Lewis acids. Germanium is very similar to silicon in its chemical behavior.\nArsenic and antimony generally form compounds in which an oxidation state of 3+ or 5+ is exhibited; however,\narsenic can form arsenides with an oxidation state of 3−. These elements tarnish only slightly in dry air but\nreadily oxidize when warmed.\nTellurium combines directly with most elements. The most stable tellurium compounds are the\ntellurides—salts of Te2−formed with active metals and lanthanides—and compounds with oxygen, fluorine, and\nchlorine, in which tellurium normally exhibits an oxidation state 2+ or 4+. Although tellurium(VI) compounds\nare known (for example, TeF6), there is a marked resistance to oxidation to this maximum group oxidation\nstate.\nStructures of the Metalloids\nCovalent bonding is the key to the crystal structures of the metalloids. In this regard, these elements resemble\nnonmetals in their behavior.\nElemental silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium are lustrous, metallic-looking solids. Silicon\nand germanium crystallize with a diamond structure. Each atom within the crystal has covalent bonds to four\nneighboring atoms at the corners of a regular tetrahedron. Single crystals of silicon and germanium are giant,\nthree-dimensional molecules. There are several allotropes of arsenic with the most stable being layer like and\ncontaining puckered sheets of arsenic atoms. Each arsenic atom forms covalent bonds to three other atoms\nwithin the sheet. The crystal structure of antimony is similar to that of arsenic, both shown in Figure 18.12.\nThe structures of arsenic and antimony are similar to the structure of graphite, covered later in this chapter.\nTellurium forms crystals that contain infinite spiral chains of tellurium atoms.

(d) Elemental tellurium forms spiral chains.\nPure crystalline boron is transparent. The crystals consist of icosahedra, as shown in Figure 18.13, with a\nboron atom at each corner. In the most common form of boron, the icosahedra pack together in a manner\nsimilar to the cubic closest packing of spheres.

In nature, it only occurs in compounds with\noxygen. Boron is widely distributed in volcanic regions as boric acid, B(OH)3, and in dry lake regions, including\nthe desert areas of California, as borates and salts of boron oxyacids, such as borax, Na2B4O7⋅10H2O.\nElemental boron is chemically inert at room temperature, reacting with only fluorine and oxygen to form\nboron trifluoride, BF3, and boric oxide, B2O3, respectively. At higher temperatures, boron reacts with all\nnonmetals, except tellurium and the noble gases, and with nearly all metals; it oxidizes to B2O3 when heated\nwith concentrated nitric or sulfuric acid. Boron does not react with nonoxidizing acids. Many boron\ncompounds react readily with water to give boric acid, B(OH)3 (sometimes written as H3BO3).\nReduction of boric oxide with magnesium powder forms boron (95–98.5% pure) as a brown, amorphous\npowder:\nAn amorphous substance is a material that appears to be a solid, but does not have a long-range order like a\ntrue solid. Treatment with hydrochloric acid removes the magnesium oxide. Further purification of the boron\nbegins with conversion of the impure boron into boron trichloride.

The\ncrust is composed almost entirely of minerals in which the silicon atoms are at the center of the silicon-oxygen\ntetrahedron, which connect in a variety of ways to produce, among other things, chains, layers, and three-\ndimensional frameworks. These minerals constitute the bulk of most common rocks, soil, and clays.

In solid B(OH)3, hydrogen bonding holds these triangular units together. Boric acid,\nshown in Figure 18.16, is a very weak acid that does not act as a proton donor but rather as a Lewis acid,\naccepting an unshared pair of electrons from the Lewis base OH−:\nFIGURE 18.16\nBoric acid has a planar structure with three –OH groups spread out equally at 120° angles from\neach other.\nHeating boric acid to 100 °C causes molecules of water to split out between pairs of adjacent –OH groups to\nform metaboric acid, HBO2. At about 150 °C, additional B-O-B linkages form, connecting the BO3 groups\ntogether with shared oxygen atoms to form tetraboric acid, H2B4O7. Complete water loss, at still higher\ntemperatures, results in boric oxide.\nBorates are salts of the oxyacids of boron. Borates result from the reactions of a base with an oxyacid or from\nthe fusion of boric acid or boric oxide with a metal oxide or hydroxide. Borate anions range from the simple\ntrigonal planar\nion to complex species containing chains and rings of three- and four-coordinated\nboron atoms. The structures of the anions found in CaB2O4, K[B5O6(OH)4]⋅2H2O (commonly written\nKB5O8⋅4H2O) and Na2[B4O5(OH)4]⋅8H2O (commonly written Na2B4O7⋅10H2O) are shown in Figure 18.17.\nCommercially, the most important borate is borax, Na2[B4O5(OH)4]⋅8H2O, which is an important component of\nsome laundry detergents. Most of the supply of borax comes directly from dry lakes, such as Searles Lake in\nCalifornia, or is prepared from kernite, Na2B4O7⋅4H2O.\n18.3 • Structure and General Properties of the Metalloids\n875",

The usual crystalline form of silicon\ndioxide is quartz, a hard, brittle, clear, colorless solid. It is useful in many ways—for architectural decorations,\nsemiprecious jewels, and frequency control in radio transmitters. Silica takes many crystalline forms, or\npolymorphs, in nature. Trace amounts of Fe3+ in quartz give amethyst its characteristic purple color. The term\nquartz is also used for articles such as tubing and lenses that are manufactured from amorphous silica. Opal is\na naturally occurring form of amorphous silica.\nThe contrast in structure and physical properties between silicon dioxide and carbon dioxide is interesting, as\nillustrated in Figure 18.18. Solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) contains single CO2 molecules with each of the two\noxygen atoms attached to the carbon atom by double bonds. Very weak intermolecular forces hold the\nmolecules together in the crystal. The volatility of dry ice reflect these weak forces between molecules. In\ncontrast, silicon dioxide is a covalent network solid. In silicon dioxide, each silicon atom links to four oxygen\natoms by single bonds directed toward the corners of a regular tetrahedron, and SiO4 tetrahedra share oxygen\natoms. This arrangement gives a three dimensional, continuous, silicon-oxygen network. A quartz crystal is a\nmacromolecule of silicon dioxide. The difference between these two compounds is the ability of the group 14\nelements to form strong π bonds. Second-period elements, such as carbon, form very strong π bonds, which is\nwhy carbon dioxide forms small molecules with strong double bonds. Elements below the second period, such\nas silicon, do not form π bonds as readily as second-period elements, and when they do form, the π bonds are\nweaker than those formed by second-period elements. For this reason, silicon dioxide does not contain π\nbonds but only σ bonds.\n876\n18 • Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

When the liquid cools, it does not crystallize readily but\nusually supercools and forms a glass, also called silica. The SiO4 tetrahedra in glassy silica have a random\narrangement characteristic of supercooled liquids, and the glass has some very useful properties. Silica is\nhighly transparent to both visible and ultraviolet light. For this reason, it is important in the manufacture of\nlamps that give radiation rich in ultraviolet light and in certain optical instruments that operate with\nultraviolet light. The coefficient of expansion of silica glass is very low; therefore, rapid temperature changes\ndo not cause it to fracture.

In nearly all silicates, sp3-hybridized\nsilicon atoms occur at the centers of tetrahedra with oxygen at the corners. There is a variation in the silicon-\nto-oxygen ratio that occurs because silicon-oxygen tetrahedra may exist as discrete, independent units or may\nshare oxygen atoms at corners in a variety of ways.

          "text": "The nonmetals are elements located in the upper right portion of the periodic table. Their properties and\nbehavior are quite different from those of metals on the left side. Under normal conditions, more than half of\nthe nonmetals are gases, one is a liquid, and the rest include some of the softest and hardest of solids. The\nnonmetals exhibit a rich variety of chemical behaviors. They include the most reactive and least reactive of\nelements, and they form many different ionic and covalent compounds. This section presents an overview of\nthe properties and chemical behaviors of the nonmetals, as well as the chemistry of specific elements. Many of\nthese nonmetals are important in biological systems.\nIn many cases, trends in electronegativity enable us to predict the type of bonding and the physical states in\ncompounds involving the nonmetals. We know that electronegativity decreases as we move down a given\ngroup and increases as we move from left to right across a period. The nonmetals have higher\nelectronegativities than do metals, and compounds formed between metals and nonmetals are generally ionic\nin nature because of the large differences in electronegativity between them. The metals form cations, the\nnonmetals form anions, and the resulting compounds are solids under normal conditions. On the other hand,\ncompounds formed between two or more nonmetals have small differences in electronegativity between the\natoms, and covalent bonding—sharing of electrons—results. These substances tend to be molecular in nature\nand are gases, liquids, or volatile solids at room temperature and pressure.\nIn normal chemical processes, nonmetals do not form monatomic positive ions (cations) because their\nionization energies are too high. All monatomic nonmetal ions are anions; examples include the chloride ion,\nCl−, the nitride ion, N3−, and the selenide ion, Se2−.\nThe common oxidation states that the nonmetals exhibit in their ionic and covalent compounds are shown in\nFigure 18.19. Remember that an element exhibits a positive oxidation state when combined with a more\nelectronegative element and that it exhibits a negative oxidation state when combined with a less\nelectronegative element.\nFIGURE 18.19\nNonmetals exhibit these common oxidation states in ionic and covalent compounds.\nThe first member of each nonmetal group exhibits different behaviors, in many respects, from the other group\nmembers. The reasons for this include smaller size, greater ionization energy, and (most important) the fact\nthat the first member of each group has only four valence orbitals (one 2s and three 2p) available for bonding,\nwhereas other group members have empty d orbitals in their valence shells, making possible five, six, or even\nmore bonds around the central atom. For example, nitrogen forms only NF3, whereas phosphorus forms both\nPF3 and PF5.\nAnother difference between the first group member and subsequent members is the greater ability of the first\nmember to form π bonds. This is primarily a function of the smaller size of the first member of each group,\nwhich allows better overlap of atomic orbitals. Nonmetals, other than the first member of each group, rarely\nform π bonds to nonmetals that are the first member of a group. For example, sulfur-oxygen π bonds are well\nknown, whereas sulfur does not normally form stable π bonds to itself.\nThe variety of oxidation states displayed by most of the nonmetals means that many of their chemical\nreactions involve changes in oxidation state through oxidation-reduction reactions. There are five general\naspects of the oxidation-reduction chemistry:\n1.\nNonmetals oxidize most metals. The oxidation state of the metal becomes positive as it undergoes\noxidation and that of the nonmetal becomes negative as it undergoes reduction. For example:\n878\n18 • Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Within any period, the strongest oxidizing agent is in group 17.\nA nonmetal often oxidizes an element that lies to its left in the same period. For example:\n4.\nThe stronger a nonmetal is as an oxidizing agent, the more difficult it is to oxidize the anion formed by the\nnonmetal. This means that the most stable negative ions are formed by elements at the top of the group or\nin group 17 of the period.\n5.\nFluorine and oxygen are the strongest oxidizing elements known. Fluorine does not form compounds in\nwhich it exhibits positive oxidation states; oxygen exhibits a positive oxidation state only when combined\nwith fluorine. For example:\nWith the exception of most of the noble gases, all nonmetals form compounds with oxygen, yielding covalent\noxides. Most of these oxides are acidic, that is, they react with water to form oxyacids. Recall from the acid-base\nchapter that an oxyacid is an acid consisting of hydrogen, oxygen, and some other element. Notable exceptions\nare carbon monoxide, CO, nitrous oxide, N2O, and nitric oxide, NO. There are three characteristics of these\nacidic oxides:\n1.\nOxides such as SO2 and N2O5, in which the nonmetal exhibits one of its common oxidation states, are acid\nanhydrides and react with water to form acids with no change in oxidation state. The product is an\noxyacid. For example:\n2.\nThose oxides such as NO2 and ClO2, in which the nonmetal does not exhibit one of its common oxidation\nstates, also react with water. In these reactions, the nonmetal is both oxidized and reduced. For example:\nReactions in which the same element is both oxidized and reduced are called disproportionation\nreactions.\n3.\nThe acid strength increases as the electronegativity of the central atom increases. To learn more, see the\ndiscussion in the chapter on acid-base chemistry.\nThe binary hydrogen compounds of the nonmetals also exhibit an acidic behavior in water, although only HCl,\nHBr, and HI are strong acids. The acid strength of the nonmetal hydrogen compounds increases from left to\nright across a period and down a group. For example, ammonia, NH3, is a weaker acid than is water, H2O,\nwhich is weaker than is hydrogen fluoride, HF. Water, H2O, is also a weaker acid than is hydrogen sulfide, H2S,\nwhich is weaker than is hydrogen selenide, H2Se. Weaker acidic character implies greater basic character.\nStructures of the Nonmetals\nThe structures of the nonmetals differ dramatically from those of metals. Metals crystallize in closely packed\narrays that do not contain molecules or covalent bonds. Nonmetal structures contain covalent bonds, and\nmany nonmetals consist of individual molecules. The electrons in nonmetals are localized in covalent bonds,\n18.4 • Structure and General Properties of the Nonmetals\n879",

Most people know of diamond, graphite, and charcoal, but fewer people know of the recent\ndiscovery of fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene.\nDescriptions of the physical properties of three nonmetals that are characteristic of molecular solids follow.\nCarbon\nCarbon occurs in the uncombined (elemental) state in many forms, such as diamond, graphite, charcoal, coke,\ncarbon black, graphene, and fullerene.\nDiamond, shown in Figure 18.20, is a very hard crystalline material that is colorless and transparent when\npure. Each atom forms four single bonds to four other atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron (sp3\nhybridization); this makes the diamond a giant molecule. Carbon-carbon single bonds are very strong, and,\nbecause they extend throughout the crystal to form a three-dimensional network, the crystals are very hard\nand have high melting points (~4400 °C).\nFIGURE 18.20\n(a) Diamond and (b) graphite are two forms of carbon.

These\nproperties relate to its structure, which consists of layers of carbon atoms, with each atom surrounded by three\nother carbon atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement. Each carbon atom in graphite forms three σ bonds, one\nto each of its nearest neighbors, by means of sp2-hybrid orbitals. The unhybridized p orbital on each carbon\natom will overlap unhybridized orbitals on adjacent carbon atoms in the same layer to form π bonds.

The weak forces between layers give graphite the soft, flaky\ncharacter that makes it useful as the so-called “lead” in pencils and the slippery character that makes it useful\nas a lubricant. The loosely held electrons in the resonating π bonds can move throughout the solid and are\nresponsible for the electrical conductivity of graphite.\nOther forms of elemental carbon include carbon black, charcoal, and coke. Carbon black is an amorphous form\nof carbon prepared by the incomplete combustion of natural gas, CH4. It is possible to produce charcoal and\ncoke by heating wood and coal, respectively, at high temperatures in the absence of air.\nRecently, new forms of elemental carbon molecules have been identified in the soot generated by a smoky\nflame and in the vapor produced when graphite is heated to very high temperatures in a vacuum or in helium.\nOne of these new forms, first isolated by Professor Richard Smalley and coworkers at Rice University, consists\nof icosahedral (soccer-ball-shaped) molecules that contain 60 carbon atoms, C60. This is buckminsterfullerene\n(often called bucky balls) after the architect Buckminster Fuller, who designed domed structures, which have a\nsimilar appearance (Figure 18.22).\nFIGURE 18.22\nThe molecular structure of C60, buckminsterfullerene, is icosahedral.\n18.4 • Structure and General Properties of the Nonmetals\n881",

Resonance stabilizes the system and leads to its conductivity. Unlike graphite, there is no\nstacking of the layers to give a three-dimensional structure. Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov at the\nUniversity of Manchester won the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics for their pioneering work characterizing\ngraphene.\nThe simplest procedure for preparing graphene is to use a piece of adhesive tape to remove a single layer\nof graphene from the surface of a piece of graphite. This method works because there are only weak\nLondon dispersion forces between the layers in graphite. Alternative methods are to deposit a single layer\nof carbon atoms on the surface of some other material (ruthenium, iridium, or copper) or to synthesize it at\nthe surface of silicon carbide via the sublimation of silicon.\nThere currently are no commercial applications of graphene. However, its unusual properties, such as high\nelectron mobility and thermal conductivity, should make it suitable for the manufacture of many advanced\nelectronic devices and for thermal management applications.\nCarbon nanotubes are carbon allotropes, which have a cylindrical structure.

When phosphorus was first\nisolated, scientists noted that it glowed in the dark and burned when exposed to air. Phosphorus is the only\nmember of its group that does not occur in the uncombined state in nature; it exists in many allotropic forms.\nWe will consider two of those forms: white phosphorus and red phosphorus.\nWhite phosphorus is a white, waxy solid that melts at 44.2 °C and boils at 280 °C. It is insoluble in water (in\nwhich it is stored—see Figure 18.24), is very soluble in carbon disulfide, and bursts into flame in air. As a solid,\nas a liquid, as a gas, and in solution, white phosphorus exists as P4 molecules with four phosphorus atoms at\nthe corners of a regular tetrahedron, as illustrated in Figure 18.24. Each phosphorus atom covalently bonds to\nthe other three atoms in the molecule by single covalent bonds. White phosphorus is the most reactive\nallotrope and is very toxic.\nFIGURE 18.24\n(a) Because white phosphorus bursts into flame in air, it is stored in water.

(credit a: modification of work from http://images-of-elements.com/phosphorus.php)\nHeating white phosphorus to 270–300 °C in the absence of air yields red phosphorus. Red phosphorus (shown\nin Figure 18.24) is denser, has a higher melting point (~600 °C), is much less reactive, is essentially nontoxic,\nand is easier and safer to handle than is white phosphorus. Its structure is highly polymeric and appears to\ncontain three-dimensional networks of P4 tetrahedra joined by P-P single bonds. Red phosphorus is insoluble\nin solvents that dissolve white phosphorus. When red phosphorus is heated, P4 molecules sublime from the\nsolid.\nSulfur\nThe allotropy of sulfur is far greater and more complex than that of any other element. Sulfur is the brimstone\nreferred to in the Bible and other places, and references to sulfur occur throughout recorded history—right up\nto the relatively recent discovery that it is a component of the atmospheres of Venus and of Io, a moon of\nJupiter. The most common and most stable allotrope of sulfur is yellow, rhombic sulfur, so named because of\nthe shape of its crystals. Rhombic sulfur is the form to which all other allotropes revert at room temperature.\nCrystals of rhombic sulfur melt at 113 °C. Cooling this liquid gives long needles of monoclinic sulfur. This form\nis stable from 96 °C to the melting point, 119 °C. At room temperature, it gradually reverts to the rhombic\nform.\nBoth rhombic sulfur and monoclinic sulfur contain S8 molecules in which atoms form eight-membered,\npuckered rings that resemble crowns, as illustrated in Figure 18.25.

If necessary, the elements form enough\ncovalent bonds to supplement the electrons already present to possess an octet. For example, members of\ngroup 15 have five valence electrons and require only three additional electrons to fill their valence shells.\nThese elements form three covalent bonds in their free state: triple bonds in the N2 molecule or single bonds\nto three different atoms in arsenic and phosphorus. The elements of group 16 require only two additional\nelectrons. Oxygen forms a double bond in the O2 molecule, and sulfur, selenium, and tellurium form two single\nbonds in various rings and chains. The halogens form diatomic molecules in which each atom is involved in\nonly one bond. This provides the electron required necessary to complete the octet on the halogen atom. The\nnoble gases do not form covalent bonds to other noble gas atoms because they already have a filled outer shell.\n18.5 Occurrence, Preparation, and Compounds of Hydrogen\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the properties, preparation, and compounds of hydrogen\nHydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. The sun and other stars are composed largely of\nhydrogen. Astronomers estimate that 90% of the atoms in the universe are hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen is a\ncomponent of more compounds than any other element. Water is the most abundant compound of hydrogen\nfound on earth. Hydrogen is an important part of petroleum, many minerals, cellulose and starch, sugar, fats,\noils, alcohols, acids, and thousands of other substances.\nAt ordinary temperatures, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and nonpoisonous gas consisting of the\ndiatomic molecule H2. Hydrogen is composed of three isotopes, and unlike other elements, these isotopes have\ndifferent names and chemical symbols: protium, 1H, deuterium, 2H (or “D”), and tritium 3H (or “T”). In a\nnaturally occurring sample of hydrogen, there is one atom of deuterium for every 7000 H atoms and one atom\nof radioactive tritium for every 1018 H atoms. The chemical properties of the different isotopes are very similar\nbecause they have identical electron structures, but they differ in some physical properties because of their\ndiffering atomic masses. Elemental deuterium and tritium have lower vapor pressure than ordinary hydrogen.\nConsequently, when liquid hydrogen evaporates, the heavier isotopes are concentrated in the last portions to\nevaporate. Electrolysis of heavy water, D2O, yields deuterium. Most tritium originates from nuclear reactions.\nPreparation of Hydrogen\nElemental hydrogen must be prepared from compounds by breaking chemical bonds. The most common\nmethods of preparing hydrogen follow.\nFrom Steam and Carbon or Hydrocarbons\nWater is the cheapest and most abundant source of hydrogen. Passing steam over coke (an impure form of\nelemental carbon) at 1000 °C produces a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen known as water gas:\nWater gas is as an industrial fuel. It is possible to produce additional hydrogen by mixing the water gas with\nsteam in the presence of a catalyst to convert the CO to CO2. This reaction is the water gas shift reaction.\nIt is also possible to prepare a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide by passing hydrocarbons from\nnatural gas or petroleum and steam over a nickel-based catalyst. Propane is an example of a hydrocarbon\nreactant:\nElectrolysis\nHydrogen forms when direct current electricity passes through water containing an electrolyte such as H2SO4,\nas illustrated in Figure 18.26. Bubbles of hydrogen form at the cathode, and oxygen evolves at the anode. The\n18.5 • Occurrence, Preparation, and Compounds of Hydrogen\n885",

Metals with lower reduction potentials\nreduce the hydrogen ion in dilute acids to produce hydrogen gas and metal salts. For example, as shown in\nFigure 18.27, iron in dilute hydrochloric acid produces hydrogen gas and iron(II) chloride:\nFIGURE 18.27\nThe reaction of iron with an acid produces hydrogen.

They are important in the inflation of life jackets, life rafts, and military balloons.\nReactions\nUnder normal conditions, hydrogen is relatively inactive chemically, but when heated, it enters into many\nchemical reactions.\nTwo thirds of the world’s hydrogen production is devoted to the manufacture of ammonia, which is a fertilizer\nand used in the manufacture of nitric acid. Large quantities of hydrogen are also important in the process of\nhydrogenation, discussed in the chapter on organic chemistry.\nIt is possible to use hydrogen as a nonpolluting fuel. The reaction of hydrogen with oxygen is a very exothermic\nreaction, releasing 286 kJ of energy per mole of water formed. Hydrogen burns without explosion under\ncontrolled conditions. The oxygen-hydrogen torch, because of the high heat of combustion of hydrogen, can\nachieve temperatures up to 2800 °C. The hot flame of this torch is useful in cutting thick sheets of many\nmetals. Liquid hydrogen is also an important rocket fuel (Figure 18.28).\nFIGURE 18.28\nBefore the fleet’s retirement in 2011, liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were used in the three\nmain engines of a space shuttle. Two compartments in the large tank held these liquids until the shuttle was\nlaunched. (credit: “reynermedia”/Flickr)\nAn uncombined hydrogen atom consists of a nucleus and one valence electron in the 1s orbital. The n = 1\nvalence shell has a capacity for two electrons, and hydrogen can rightfully occupy two locations in the periodic\ntable. It is possible to consider hydrogen a group 1 element because hydrogen can lose an electron to form the\ncation, H+. It is also possible to consider hydrogen to be a group 17 element because it needs only one electron\nto fill its valence orbital to form a hydride ion, H−, or it can share an electron to form a single, covalent bond. In\nreality, hydrogen is a unique element that almost deserves its own location in the periodic table.\nReactions with Elements\nWhen heated, hydrogen reacts with the metals of group 1 and with Ca, Sr, and Ba (the more active metals in\ngroup 2). The compounds formed are crystalline, ionic hydrides that contain the hydride anion, H−, a strong\nreducing agent and a strong base, which reacts vigorously with water and other acids to form hydrogen gas.\nThe reactions of hydrogen with nonmetals generally produce acidic hydrogen compounds with hydrogen in\nthe 1+ oxidation state. The reactions become more exothermic and vigorous as the electronegativity of the\nnonmetal increases. Hydrogen reacts with nitrogen and sulfur only when heated, but it reacts explosively with\nfluorine (forming HF) and, under some conditions, with chlorine (forming HCl). A mixture of hydrogen and\noxygen explodes if ignited. Because of the explosive nature of the reaction, it is necessary to exercise caution\nwhen handling hydrogen (or any other combustible gas) to avoid the formation of an explosive mixture in a\nconfined space. Although most hydrides of the nonmetals are acidic, ammonia and phosphine (PH3) are very,\nvery weak acids and generally function as bases.

The acid-base reaction with the weakly acidic ammonium ion gives ammonia, illustrated in\nFigure 18.29. Ammonia also forms when ionic nitrides react with water.

Smelling salts utilize this powerful odor. Gaseous\nammonia readily liquefies to give a colorless liquid that boils at −33 °C.

Hydrogen and\n(depending on the stoichiometry) amides (salts of\nimides (salts of NH2−), or nitrides (salts of N3−)\nform.\n3.\nThe nitrogen atom in ammonia has its lowest possible oxidation state (3−) and thus is not susceptible to\nreduction. However, it can be oxidized. Ammonia burns in air, giving NO and water. Hot ammonia and the\nammonium ion are active reducing agents. Of particular interest are the oxidations of ammonium ion by\nnitrite ion,\nto yield pure nitrogen and by nitrate ion to yield nitrous oxide, N2O.\n4.\nThere are a number of compounds that we can consider derivatives of ammonia through the replacement\nof one or more hydrogen atoms with some other atom or group of atoms. Inorganic derivations include\nchloramine, NH2Cl, and hydrazine, N2H4:\nChloramine, NH2Cl, results from the reaction of sodium hypochlorite, NaOCl, with ammonia in basic solution.\nIn the presence of a large excess of ammonia at low temperature, the chloramine reacts further to produce\nhydrazine, N2H4:\nAnhydrous hydrazine is relatively stable in spite of its positive free energy of formation:\nHydrazine is a fuming, colorless liquid that has some physical properties remarkably similar to those of H2O (it\nmelts at 2 °C, boils at 113.5 °C, and has a density at 25 °C of 1.00 g/mL).

Unlike ammonia, it is not possible to form phosphine by direct union of the elements.\nThere are two methods for the preparation of phosphine. One method is by the action of an acid on an ionic\nphosphide. The other method is the disproportionation of white phosphorus with hot concentrated base to\nproduce phosphine and the hydrogen phosphite ion:\nPhosphine is a colorless, very poisonous gas, which has an odor like that of decaying fish. Heat easily\ndecomposes phosphine\nand the compound burns in air. The major uses of phosphine\nare as a fumigant for grains and in semiconductor processing. Like ammonia, gaseous phosphine unites with\ngaseous hydrogen halides, forming phosphonium compounds like PH4Cl and PH4I.

Hydrogen sulfide is as toxic as hydrogen cyanide; therefore, it is necessary to exercise great care in\nhandling it. Hydrogen sulfide is particularly deceptive because it paralyzes the olfactory nerves; after a short\nexposure, one does not smell it.\nThe production of hydrogen sulfide by the direct reaction of the elements (H2 + S) is unsatisfactory because the\nyield is low. A more effective preparation method is the reaction of a metal sulfide with a dilute acid. For\nexample:\nIt is easy to oxidize the sulfur in metal sulfides and in hydrogen sulfide, making metal sulfides and H2S good\nreducing agents. In acidic solutions, hydrogen sulfide reduces Fe3+ to Fe2+,\nto Mn2+,\nto Cr3+,\nand HNO3 to NO2. The sulfur in H2S usually oxidizes to elemental sulfur, unless a large excess of the oxidizing\nagent is present. In which case, the sulfide may oxidize to\nor\n(or to SO2 or SO3 in the absence of\nwater):\nThis oxidation process leads to the removal of the hydrogen sulfide found in many sources of natural gas. The\ndeposits of sulfur in volcanic regions may be the result of the oxidation of H2S present in volcanic gases.\nHydrogen sulfide is a weak diprotic acid that dissolves in water to form hydrosulfuric acid. The acid ionizes in\ntwo stages, yielding hydrogen sulfide ions, HS−, in the first stage and sulfide ions, S2−, in the second. Since\nhydrogen sulfide is a weak acid, aqueous solutions of soluble sulfides and hydrogen sulfides are basic:\nHalogen Hydrogen Compounds\nBinary compounds containing only hydrogen and a halogen are hydrogen halides. At room temperature, the\npure hydrogen halides HF, HCl, HBr, and HI are gases.\nIn general, it is possible to prepare the halides by the general techniques used to prepare other acids. Fluorine,\nchlorine, and bromine react directly with hydrogen to form the respective hydrogen halide. This is a\ncommercially important reaction for preparing hydrogen chloride and hydrogen bromide.\nThe acid-base reaction between a nonvolatile strong acid and a metal halide will yield a hydrogen halide. The\nescape of the gaseous hydrogen halide drives the reaction to completion. For example, the usual method of\npreparing hydrogen fluoride is by heating a mixture of calcium fluoride, CaF2, and concentrated sulfuric acid:\nGaseous hydrogen fluoride is also a by-product in the preparation of phosphate fertilizers by the reaction of\nfluoroapatite, Ca5(PO4)3F, with sulfuric acid. The reaction of concentrated sulfuric acid with a chloride salt\nproduces hydrogen chloride both commercially and in the laboratory.\nIn most cases, sodium chloride is the chloride of choice because it is the least expensive chloride. Hydrogen\nbromide and hydrogen iodide cannot be prepared using sulfuric acid because this acid is an oxidizing agent\ncapable of oxidizing both bromide and iodide. However, it is possible to prepare both hydrogen bromide and\nhydrogen iodide using an acid such as phosphoric acid because it is a weaker oxidizing agent. For example:\nAll of the hydrogen halides are very soluble in water, forming hydrohalic acids. With the exception of hydrogen\nfluoride, which has a strong hydrogen-fluoride bond, they are strong acids. Reactions of hydrohalic acids with\nmetals, metal hydroxides, oxides, or carbonates produce salts of the halides. Most chloride salts are soluble in\nwater. AgCl, PbCl2, and Hg2Cl2 are the commonly encountered exceptions.\n890\n18 • Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Examples of such reactions include:\nThe carbonates of the alkaline earth metals of group 12 and lead(II) are not soluble. These carbonates\nprecipitate upon mixing a solution of soluble alkali metal carbonate with a solution of soluble salts of these\nmetals. Examples of net ionic equations for the reactions are:\nPearls and the shells of most mollusks are calcium carbonate.

The atmosphere consists of 78%\nnitrogen by volume. This means there are more than 20 million tons of nitrogen over every square mile of the\nearth’s surface. Nitrogen is a component of proteins and of the genetic material (DNA/RNA) of all plants and\nanimals.\nUnder ordinary conditions, nitrogen is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas. It boils at 77 K and freezes at 63\nK. Liquid nitrogen is a useful coolant because it is inexpensive and has a low boiling point. Nitrogen is very\nunreactive because of the very strong triple bond between the nitrogen atoms. The only common reactions at\nroom temperature occur with lithium to form Li3N, with certain transition metal complexes, and with\nhydrogen or oxygen in nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The general lack of reactivity of nitrogen makes the\nremarkable ability of some bacteria to synthesize nitrogen compounds using atmospheric nitrogen gas as the\nsource one of the most exciting chemical events on our planet. This process is one type of nitrogen fixation. In\nthis case, nitrogen fixation is the process where organisms convert atmospheric nitrogen into biologically\nuseful chemicals. Nitrogen fixation also occurs when lightning passes through air, causing molecular nitrogen\nto react with oxygen to form nitrogen oxides, which are then carried down to the soil.\n18.7 • Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Nitrogen\n893",

This technology allows\nfresh produce to be available year-round, regardless of growing season.\nThere are compounds with nitrogen in all of its oxidation states from 3− to 5+. Much of the chemistry of\nnitrogen involves oxidation-reduction reactions. Some active metals (such as alkali metals and alkaline earth\nmetals) can reduce nitrogen to form metal nitrides. In the remainder of this section, we will examine nitrogen-\noxygen chemistry.\nThere are well-characterized nitrogen oxides in which nitrogen exhibits each of its positive oxidation numbers\nfrom 1+ to 5+. When ammonium nitrate is carefully heated, nitrous oxide (dinitrogen oxide) and water vapor\nform. Stronger heating generates nitrogen gas, oxygen gas, and water vapor.

The earth’s surface is composed of the crust,\natmosphere, and hydrosphere. About 50% of the mass of the earth’s crust consists of oxygen (combined with\nother elements, principally silicon). Oxygen occurs as O2 molecules and, to a limited extent, as O3 (ozone)\nmolecules in air. It forms about 20% of the mass of the air. About 89% of water by mass consists of combined\noxygen. In combination with carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, oxygen is a large part of plants and animals.\nOxygen is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas at ordinary temperatures. It is slightly denser than air.\nAlthough it is only slightly soluble in water (49 mL of gas dissolves in 1 L at STP), oxygen’s solubility is very\nimportant to aquatic life.\nMost of the oxygen isolated commercially comes from air and the remainder from the electrolysis of water. The\nseparation of oxygen from air begins with cooling and compressing the air until it liquefies. As liquid air\nwarms, oxygen with its higher boiling point (90 K) separates from nitrogen, which has a lower boiling point (77\nK). It is possible to separate the other components of air at the same time based on differences in their boiling\npoints.\nOxygen is essential in combustion processes such as the burning of fuels. Plants and animals use the oxygen\nfrom the air in respiration. The administration of oxygen-enriched air is an important medical practice when a\npatient is receiving an inadequate supply of oxygen because of shock, pneumonia, or some other illness.\nThe chemical industry employs oxygen for oxidizing many substances. A significant amount of oxygen\nproduced commercially is important in the removal of carbon from iron during steel production. Large\nquantities of pure oxygen are also necessary in metal fabrication and in the cutting and welding of metals with\n18.9 • Occurrence, Preparation, and Compounds of Oxygen\n899",

It is also the source\nof gaseous oxygen for life support in space.\nAs we know, oxygen is very important to life. The energy required for the maintenance of normal body\nfunctions in human beings and in other organisms comes from the slow oxidation of chemical compounds.\nOxygen is the final oxidizing agent in these reactions. In humans, oxygen passes from the lungs into the blood,\nwhere it combines with hemoglobin, producing oxyhemoglobin. In this form, blood transports the oxygen to\ntissues, where it is transferred to the tissues. The ultimate products are carbon dioxide and water. The blood\ncarries the carbon dioxide through the veins to the lungs, where the blood releases the carbon dioxide and\ncollects another supply of oxygen. Digestion and assimilation of food regenerate the materials consumed by\noxidation in the body; the energy liberated is the same as if the food burned outside the body.\nGreen plants continually replenish the oxygen in the atmosphere by a process called photosynthesis. The\nproducts of photosynthesis may vary, but, in general, the process converts carbon dioxide and water into\nglucose (a sugar) and oxygen using the energy of light:\nThus, the oxygen that became carbon dioxide and water by the metabolic processes in plants and animals\nreturns to the atmosphere by photosynthesis.\nWhen dry oxygen is passed between two electrically charged plates, ozone (O3, illustrated in Figure 18.42), an\nallotrope of oxygen possessing a distinctive odor, forms. The formation of ozone from oxygen is an\nendothermic reaction, in which the energy comes from an electrical discharge, heat, or ultraviolet light:\nThe sharp odor associated with sparking electrical equipment is due, in part, to ozone.\nFIGURE 18.42\nThe image shows the bent ozone (O3) molecule and the resonance structures necessary to describe\nits bonding.\nOzone forms naturally in the upper atmosphere by the action of ultraviolet light from the sun on the oxygen\nthere. Most atmospheric ozone occurs in the stratosphere, a layer of the atmosphere extending from about 10\nto 50 kilometers above the earth’s surface. This ozone acts as a barrier to harmful ultraviolet light from the sun\nby absorbing it via a chemical decomposition reaction:\nThe reactive oxygen atoms recombine with molecular oxygen to complete the ozone cycle. The presence of\nstratospheric ozone decreases the frequency of skin cancer and other damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation.\nIt has been clearly demonstrated that chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs (known commercially as Freons), which were\n900\n18 • Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

The\nchlorine atoms react with ozone molecules, resulting in a net removal of O3 molecules from stratosphere. This\nprocess is explored in detail in our coverage of chemical kinetics. There is a worldwide effort to reduce the\namount of CFCs used commercially, and the ozone hole is already beginning to decrease in size as atmospheric\nconcentrations of atomic chlorine decrease. While ozone in the stratosphere helps protect us, ozone in the\ntroposphere is a problem. This ozone is a toxic component of photochemical smog.\nThe uses of ozone depend on its reactivity with other substances. It can be used as a bleaching agent for oils,\nwaxes, fabrics, and starch: It oxidizes the colored compounds in these substances to colorless compounds. It is\nan alternative to chlorine as a disinfectant for water.\nReactions\nElemental oxygen is a strong oxidizing agent. It reacts with most other elements and many compounds.\nReaction with Elements\nOxygen reacts directly at room temperature or at elevated temperatures with all other elements except the\nnoble gases, the halogens, and few second- and third-row transition metals of low reactivity (those with higher\nreduction potentials than copper). Rust is an example of the reaction of oxygen with iron. The more active\nmetals form peroxides or superoxides. Less active metals and the nonmetals give oxides. Two examples of\nthese reactions are:\nThe oxides of halogens, at least one of the noble gases, and metals with higher reduction potentials than\ncopper do not form by the direct action of the elements with oxygen.\nReaction with Compounds\nElemental oxygen also reacts with some compounds. If it is possible to oxidize any of the elements in a given\ncompound, further oxidation by oxygen can occur. For example, hydrogen sulfide, H2S, contains sulfur with an\noxidation state of 2−. Because the sulfur does not exhibit its maximum oxidation state, we would expect H2S to\nreact with oxygen. It does, yielding water and sulfur dioxide. The reaction is:\nIt is also possible to oxidize oxides such as CO and P4O6 that contain an element with a lower oxidation state.\nThe ease with which elemental oxygen picks up electrons is mirrored by the difficulty of removing electrons\nfrom oxygen in most oxides. Of the elements, only the very reactive fluorine can oxidize oxides to form oxygen\ngas.\nOxides, Peroxides, and Hydroxides\nCompounds of the representative metals with oxygen fall into three categories: (1) oxides, containing oxide\nions, O2−; (2) peroxides, containing peroxides ions,\nwith oxygen-oxygen covalent single bonds and a\nvery limited number of superoxides, containing superoxide ions,\nwith oxygen-oxygen covalent bonds\nthat have a bond order of\nIn addition, there are (3) hydroxides, containing hydroxide ions, OH−. All\nrepresentative metals form oxides. Some of the metals of group 2 also form peroxides, MO2, and the metals of\ngroup 1 also form peroxides, M2O2, and superoxides, MO2.\nOxides\nIt is possible to produce the oxides of most representative metals by heating the corresponding hydroxides\n(forming the oxide and gaseous water) or carbonates (forming the oxide and gaseous CO2).

Alkali metal\noxides result from the oxidation-reduction reactions created by heating nitrates or hydroxides with the metals.\nEquations for sample reactions are:\nWith the exception of mercury(II) oxide, it is possible to produce the oxides of the metals of groups 2–15 by\nburning the corresponding metal in air. The heaviest member of each group, the member for which the inert\npair effect is most pronounced, forms an oxide in which the oxidation state of the metal ion is two less than the\ngroup oxidation state (inert pair effect). Thus, Tl2O, PbO, and Bi2O3 form when burning thallium, lead, and\nbismuth, respectively. The oxides of the lighter members of each group exhibit the group oxidation state. For\nexample, SnO2 forms from burning tin. Mercury(II) oxide, HgO, forms slowly when mercury is warmed below\n500 °C; it decomposes at higher temperatures.\nBurning the members of groups 1 and 2 in air is not a suitable way to form the oxides of these elements. These\nmetals are reactive enough to combine with nitrogen in the air, so they form mixtures of oxides and ionic\nnitrides. Several also form peroxides or superoxides when heated in air.\nIonic oxides all contain the oxide ion, a very powerful hydrogen ion acceptor.

It is possible to prepare calcium hydroxide by the familiar acid-base reaction of a soluble metal\noxide with water:\nBoth CaO and Ca(OH)2 are useful as bases; they accept protons and neutralize acids.\nAlumina (Al2O3) occurs in nature as the mineral corundum, a very hard substance used as an abrasive for\ngrinding and polishing. Corundum is important to the jewelry trade as ruby and sapphire. The color of ruby is\ndue to the presence of a small amount of chromium; other impurities produce the wide variety of colors\npossible for sapphires.

Lead dioxide is a constituent of charged lead storage batteries. Lead(IV) tends to revert to the\nmore stable lead(II) ion by gaining two electrons, so lead dioxide is a powerful oxidizing agent.\nFIGURE 18.44\nZinc oxide protects exposed skin from sunburn.

It is possible to prepare pure orthophosphoric acid by dissolving P4O10 in water.\nThe action of water on P4O6, PCl3, PBr3, or PI3 forms phosphorous acid, H3PO3 (shown in Figure 18.53). The\nbest method for preparing pure phosphorous acid is by hydrolyzing phosphorus trichloride:\nHeating the resulting solution expels the hydrogen chloride and leads to the evaporation of water. When\nsufficient water evaporates, white crystals of phosphorous acid will appear upon cooling. The crystals are\ndeliquescent, very soluble in water, and have an odor like that of garlic. The solid melts at 70.1 °C and\ndecomposes at about 200 °C by disproportionation into phosphine and orthophosphoric acid:\n18.9 • Occurrence, Preparation, and Compounds of Oxygen\n909",

It is not possible to replace the third atom of hydrogen\nbecause it is not very acidic, as it is not easy to ionize the P-H bond.\nSulfur Oxyacids and Salts\nThe preparation of sulfuric acid, H2SO4 (shown in Figure 18.54), begins with the oxidation of sulfur to sulfur\ntrioxide and then converting the trioxide to sulfuric acid. Pure sulfuric acid is a colorless, oily liquid that\nfreezes at 10.5 °C. It fumes when heated because the acid decomposes to water and sulfur trioxide. The heating\nprocess causes the loss of more sulfur trioxide than water, until reaching a concentration of 98.33% acid. Acid\nof this concentration boils at 338 °C without further change in concentration (a constant boiling solution) and\nis commercially concentrated H2SO4. The amount of sulfuric acid used in industry exceeds that of any other\nmanufactured compound.\nFIGURE 18.54\nSulfuric acid has a tetrahedral molecular structure.\nThe strong affinity of concentrated sulfuric acid for water makes it a good dehydrating agent. It is possible to\ndry gases and immiscible liquids that do not react with the acid by passing them through the acid.\nSulfuric acid is a strong diprotic acid that ionizes in two stages. In aqueous solution, the first stage is\nessentially complete. The secondary ionization is not nearly so complete, and\nis a moderately strong\nacid (about 25% ionized in solution of a\nsalt: Ka = 1.2\n10−2).\nBeing a diprotic acid, sulfuric acid forms both sulfates, such as Na2SO4, and hydrogen sulfates, such as\nNaHSO4. Most sulfates are soluble in water; however, the sulfates of barium, strontium, calcium, and lead are\nonly slightly soluble in water.\nAmong the important sulfates are Na2SO4⋅10H2O and Epsom salts, MgSO4⋅7H2O. Because the\nion is an\nacid, hydrogen sulfates, such as NaHSO4, exhibit acidic behavior, and this compound is the primary ingredient\nin some household cleansers.\nHot, concentrated sulfuric acid is an oxidizing agent. Depending on its concentration, the temperature, and the\nstrength of the reducing agent, sulfuric acid oxidizes many compounds and, in the process, undergoes\nreduction to SO2,\nS, H2S, or S2−.\nSulfur dioxide dissolves in water to form a solution of sulfurous acid, as expected for the oxide of a nonmetal.\n910\n18 • Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Ionization is\nabout 25% in the first stage, but it is much less in the second (Ka1 = 1.2\n10−2 and Ka2 = 6.2\n10−8).\nIn order to prepare solid sulfite and hydrogen sulfite salts, it is necessary to add a stoichiometric amount of a\nbase to a sulfurous acid solution and then evaporate the water.

Oxygen in the air oxidizes it slowly to the more stable\nsulfuric acid:\nSolutions of sulfites are also very susceptible to air oxidation to produce sulfates.

The strengths of these acids increase from the hypohalous acids, which are\nvery weak acids, to the perhalic acids, which are very strong.

Transferring the mixture to large settling vats allows the solid sulfur to\nseparate upon cooling. This sulfur is 99.5% to 99.9% pure and requires no purification for most uses.\nFIGURE 18.59\nThe Frasch process is used to mine sulfur from underground deposits.\nLarger amounts of sulfur also come from hydrogen sulfide recovered during the purification of natural gas.\nSulfur exists in several allotropic forms. The stable form at room temperature contains eight-membered rings,\nand so the true formula is S8. However, chemists commonly use S to simplify the coefficients in chemical\nequations; we will follow this practice in this book.\nLike oxygen, which is also a member of group 16, sulfur exhibits a distinctly nonmetallic behavior. It oxidizes\nmetals, giving a variety of binary sulfides in which sulfur exhibits a negative oxidation state (2−). Elemental\nsulfur oxidizes less electronegative nonmetals, and more electronegative nonmetals, such as oxygen and the\nhalogens, will oxidize it. Other strong oxidizing agents also oxidize sulfur.

These are the elements fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and\nastatine. These elements are too reactive to occur freely in nature, but their compounds are widely distributed.\nChlorides are the most abundant; although fluorides, bromides, and iodides are less common, they are\nreasonably available. In this section, we will examine the occurrence, preparation, and properties of halogens.\nNext, we will examine halogen compounds with the representative metals followed by an examination of the\ninterhalogens. This section will conclude with some applications of halogens.\nOccurrence and Preparation\nAll of the halogens occur in seawater as halide ions. The concentration of the chloride ion is 0.54 M; that of the\nother halides is less than 10–4 M. Fluoride also occurs in minerals such as CaF2, Ca(PO4)3F, and Na3AlF6.\nChloride also occurs in the Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea, and in extensive salt beds that contain NaCl, KCl,\nor MgCl2. Part of the chlorine in your body is present as hydrochloric acid, which is a component of stomach\nacid. Bromine compounds occur in the Dead Sea and underground brines. Iodine compounds are found in\nsmall quantities in Chile saltpeter, underground brines, and sea kelp. Iodine is essential to the function of the\nthyroid gland.\nThe best sources of halogens (except iodine) are halide salts. It is possible to oxidize the halide ions to free\ndiatomic halogen molecules by various methods, depending on the ease of oxidation of the halide ion. Fluoride\nis the most difficult to oxidize, whereas iodide is the easiest.\nThe major method for preparing fluorine is electrolytic oxidation. The most common electrolysis procedure is\nto use a molten mixture of potassium hydrogen fluoride, KHF2, and anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. Electrolysis\ncauses HF to decompose, forming fluorine gas at the anode and hydrogen at the cathode. It is necessary to\nkeep the two gases separated to prevent their explosive recombination to reform hydrogen fluoride.\nMost commercial chlorine comes from the electrolysis of the chloride ion in aqueous solutions of sodium\nchloride; this is the chlor-alkali process discussed previously. Chlorine is also a product of the electrolytic\nproduction of metals such as sodium, calcium, and magnesium from their fused chlorides. It is also possible to\nprepare chlorine by the chemical oxidation of the chloride ion in acid solution with strong oxidizing agents\nsuch as manganese dioxide (MnO2) or sodium dichromate (Na2Cr2O7). The reaction with manganese dioxide is:\nThe commercial preparation of bromine involves the oxidation of bromide ion by chlorine:\nChlorine is a stronger oxidizing agent than bromine. This method is important for the production of essentially\nall domestic bromine.\nSome iodine comes from the oxidation of iodine chloride, ICl, or iodic acid, HlO3. The commercial preparation\nof iodine utilizes the reduction of sodium iodate, NaIO3, an impurity in deposits of Chile saltpeter, with sodium\nhydrogen sulfite:\n18.11 • Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Halogens\n915",

Liquid bromine has a high vapor pressure, and the reddish vapor is\nreadily visible in Figure 18.60. Iodine crystals have a noticeable vapor pressure. When gently heated, these\ncrystals sublime and form a beautiful deep violet vapor.\nFIGURE 18.60\nChlorine is a pale yellow-green gas (left), gaseous bromine is deep orange (center), and gaseous\niodine is purple (right).

(credit: Sahar Atwa)\nBromine is only slightly soluble in water, but it is miscible in all proportions in less polar (or nonpolar) solvents\nsuch as chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, and carbon disulfide, forming solutions that vary from yellow to\nreddish-brown, depending on the concentration.\nIodine is soluble in chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, carbon disulfide, and many hydrocarbons, giving violet\nsolutions of I2 molecules. Iodine dissolves only slightly in water, giving brown solutions. It is quite soluble in\naqueous solutions of iodides, with which it forms brown solutions. These brown solutions result because\niodine molecules have empty valence d orbitals and can act as weak Lewis acids towards the iodide ion. The\nequation for the reversible reaction of iodine (Lewis acid) with the iodide ion (Lewis base) to form triiodide ion,\nis:\nThe easier it is to oxidize the halide ion, the more difficult it is for the halogen to act as an oxidizing agent.\nFluorine generally oxidizes an element to its highest oxidation state, whereas the heavier halogens may not.\nFor example, when excess fluorine reacts with sulfur, SF6 forms. Chlorine gives SCl2 and bromine, S2Br2.\nIodine does not react with sulfur.\nFluorine is the most powerful oxidizing agent of the known elements. It spontaneously oxidizes most other\nelements; therefore, the reverse reaction, the oxidation of fluorides, is very difficult to accomplish. Fluorine\nreacts directly and forms binary fluorides with all of the elements except the lighter noble gases (He, Ne, and\nAr). Fluorine is such a strong oxidizing agent that many substances ignite on contact with it. Drops of water\ninflame in fluorine and form O2, OF2, H2O2, O3, and HF. Wood and asbestos ignite and burn in fluorine gas.\nMost hot metals burn vigorously in fluorine. However, it is possible to handle fluorine in copper, iron, or nickel\ncontainers because an adherent film of the fluoride salt passivates their surfaces. Fluorine is the only element\nthat reacts directly with the noble gas xenon.\nAlthough it is a strong oxidizing agent, chlorine is less active than fluorine. Mixing chlorine and hydrogen in\nthe dark makes the reaction between them to be imperceptibly slow. Exposure of the mixture to light causes\nthe two to react explosively. Chlorine is also less active towards metals than fluorine, and oxidation reactions\nusually require higher temperatures. Molten sodium ignites in chlorine. Chlorine attacks most nonmetals (C,\nN2, and O2 are notable exceptions), forming covalent molecular compounds. Chlorine generally reacts with\ncompounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen (hydrocarbons) by adding to multiple bonds or by\nsubstitution.\n916\n18 • Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

They earned\nthe name “noble” because they were assumed to be nonreactive since they have filled valence shells. In 1962,\nDr. Neil Bartlett at the University of British Columbia proved this assumption to be false.\nThese elements are present in the atmosphere in small amounts. Some natural gas contains 1–2% helium by\nmass. Helium is isolated from natural gas by liquefying the condensable components, leaving only helium as a\ngas. The United States possesses most of the world’s commercial supply of this element in its helium-bearing\ngas fields. Argon, neon, krypton, and xenon come from the fractional distillation of liquid air. Radon comes\nfrom other radioactive elements.

Its accumulation in well-insulated, tightly sealed buildings, however,\nconstitutes a health hazard, primarily lung cancer.\nThe boiling points and melting points of the noble gases are extremely low relative to those of other substances\nof comparable atomic or molecular masses. This is because only weak London dispersion forces are present,\nand these forces can hold the atoms together only when molecular motion is very slight, as it is at very low\ntemperatures. Helium is the only substance known that does not solidify on cooling at normal pressure. It\nremains liquid close to absolute zero (0.001 K) at ordinary pressures, but it solidifies under elevated pressure.\nHelium is used for filling balloons and lighter-than-air craft because it does not burn, making it safer to use\nthan hydrogen. Helium at high pressures is not a narcotic like nitrogen. Thus, mixtures of oxygen and helium\nare important for divers working under high pressures. Using a helium-oxygen mixture avoids the disoriented\nmental state known as nitrogen narcosis, the so-called rapture of the deep. Helium is important as an inert\natmosphere for the melting and welding of easily oxidizable metals and for many chemical processes that are\nsensitive to air.\nLiquid helium (boiling point, 4.2 K) is an important coolant to reach the low temperatures necessary for\ncryogenic research, and it is essential for achieving the low temperatures necessary to produce\nsuperconduction in traditional superconducting materials used in powerful magnets and other devices. This\ncooling ability is necessary for the magnets used for magnetic resonance imaging, a common medical\ndiagnostic procedure. The other common coolant is liquid nitrogen (boiling point, 77 K), which is significantly\ncheaper.\nNeon is a component of neon lamps and signs. Passing an electric spark through a tube containing neon at low\npressure generates the familiar red glow of neon. It is possible to change the color of the light by mixing argon\nor mercury vapor with the neon or by utilizing glass tubes of a special color.\nArgon was useful in the manufacture of gas-filled electric light bulbs, where its lower heat conductivity and\nchemical inertness made it preferable to nitrogen for inhibiting the vaporization of the tungsten filament and\nprolonging the life of the bulb. Fluorescent tubes commonly contain a mixture of argon and mercury vapor.\nArgon is the third most abundant gas in dry air.\nKrypton-xenon flash tubes are used to take high-speed photographs. An electric discharge through such a tube\ngives a very intense light that lasts only\nof a second. Krypton forms a difluoride, KrF2, which is\nthermally unstable at room temperature.\nStable compounds of xenon form when xenon reacts with fluorine. Xenon difluoride, XeF2, forms after heating\nan excess of xenon gas with fluorine gas and then cooling. The material forms colorless crystals, which are\nstable at room temperature in a dry atmosphere. Xenon tetrafluoride, XeF4, and xenon hexafluoride, XeF6, are\nprepared in an analogous manner, with a stoichiometric amount of fluorine and an excess of fluorine,\nrespectively. Compounds with oxygen are prepared by replacing fluorine atoms in the xenon fluorides with\noxygen.\nWhen XeF6 reacts with water, a solution of XeO3 results and the xenon remains in the 6+-oxidation state:\nDry, solid xenon trioxide, XeO3, is extremely explosive—it will spontaneously detonate. Both XeF6 and XeO3\ndisproportionate in basic solution, producing xenon, oxygen, and salts of the perxenate ion,\nin which\nxenon reaches its maximum oxidation sate of 8+.\nRadon apparently forms RnF2—evidence of this compound comes from radiochemical tracer techniques.\nUnstable compounds of argon form at low temperatures, but stable compounds of helium and neon are not\nknown.\n18.12 • Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of the Noble Gases\n921",

These are the elements\nwhere the electrons are entering the s and p orbitals.\nThe representative elements occur in groups 1, 2,\nand 12–18. These elements are representative\nmetals, metalloids, and nonmetals. The alkali metals\n(group 1) are very reactive, readily form ions with a\ncharge of 1+ to form ionic compounds that are\nusually soluble in water, and react vigorously with\nwater to form hydrogen gas and a basic solution of\nthe metal hydroxide. The outermost electrons of the\nalkaline earth metals (group 2) are more difficult to\nremove than the outer electron of the alkali metals,\nleading to the group 2 metals being less reactive\nthan those in group 1. These elements easily form\ncompounds in which the metals exhibit an oxidation\nstate of 2+. Zinc, cadmium, and mercury (group 12)\ncommonly exhibit the group oxidation state of 2+\n(although mercury also exhibits an oxidation state of\n1+ in compounds that contain\nAluminum,\ngallium, indium, and thallium (group 13) are easier\nto oxidize than is hydrogen. Aluminum, gallium, and\nindium occur with an oxidation state 3+ (however,\nthallium also commonly occurs as the Tl+ ion). Tin\nand lead form stable divalent cations and covalent\ncompounds in which the metals exhibit the 4+-\noxidation state.\n18.2 Occurrence and Preparation of the\nRepresentative Metals\nBecause of their chemical reactivity, it is necessary\nto produce the representative metals in their pure\nforms by reduction from naturally occurring\ncompounds. Electrolysis is important in the\nproduction of sodium, potassium, and aluminum.\nChemical reduction is the primary method for the\nisolation of magnesium, zinc, and tin. Similar\nprocedures are important for the other\nrepresentative metals.\n18.3 Structure and General Properties of the\nMetalloids\nThe elements boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic,\nantimony, and tellurium separate the metals from\nthe nonmetals in the periodic table. These elements,\ncalled metalloids or sometimes semimetals, exhibit\nproperties characteristic of both metals and\nnonmetals. The structures of these elements are\nsimilar in many ways to those of nonmetals, but the\nelements are electrical semiconductors.\n18.4 Structure and General Properties of the\nNonmetals\nNonmetals have structures that are very different\nfrom those of the metals, primarily because they\nhave greater electronegativity and electrons that are\nmore tightly bound to individual atoms. Most\nnonmetal oxides are acid anhydrides, meaning that\nthey react with water to form acidic solutions.\nMolecular structures are common for most of the\nnonmetals, and several have multiple allotropes\nwith varying physical properties.\n18.5 Occurrence, Preparation, and\nCompounds of Hydrogen\nHydrogen is the most abundant element in the\nuniverse and its chemistry is truly unique. Although\nit has some chemical reactivity that is similar to that\nof the alkali metals, hydrogen has many of the same\nchemical properties of a nonmetal with a relatively\nlow electronegativity. It forms ionic hydrides with\nactive metals, covalent compounds in which it has\nan oxidation state of 1− with less electronegative\nelements, and covalent compounds in which it has\nan oxidation state of 1+ with more electronegative\nnonmetals. It reacts explosively with oxygen,\nfluorine, and chlorine, less readily with bromine,\nand much less readily with iodine, sulfur, and\nnitrogen. Hydrogen reduces the oxides of metals\nwith lower reduction potentials than chromium to\nform the metal and water. The hydrogen halides are\nall acidic when dissolved in water.\n18.6 Occurrence, Preparation, and\nProperties of Carbonates\nThe usual method for the preparation of the\ncarbonates of the alkali and alkaline earth metals is\nby reaction of an oxide or hydroxide with carbon\ndioxide. Other carbonates form by precipitation.\nMetal carbonates or hydrogen carbonates such as\nlimestone (CaCO3), the antacid Tums (CaCO3), and\nbaking soda (NaHCO3) are common examples.\nCarbonates and hydrogen carbonates decompose in\n18 • Summary\n923",

Because of the stability of the N≡N triple\nbond, it requires a great deal of energy to make\ncompounds from molecular nitrogen. Active metals\nsuch as the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals\ncan reduce nitrogen to form metal nitrides. Nitrogen\noxides and nitrogen hydrides are also important\nsubstances.\n18.8 Occurrence, Preparation, and\nProperties of Phosphorus\nPhosphorus (group 15) commonly exhibits oxidation\nstates of 3− with active metals and of 3+ and 5+ with\nmore electronegative nonmetals. The halogens and\noxygen will oxidize phosphorus. The oxides are\nphosphorus(V) oxide, P4O10, and phosphorus(III)\noxide, P4O6. The two common methods for\npreparing orthophosphoric acid, H3PO4, are either\nthe reaction of a phosphate with sulfuric acid or the\nreaction of water with phosphorus(V) oxide.\nOrthophosphoric acid is a triprotic acid that forms\nthree types of salts.\n18.9 Occurrence, Preparation, and\nCompounds of Oxygen\nOxygen is one of the most reactive elements. This\nreactivity, coupled with its abundance, makes the\nchemistry of oxygen very rich and well understood.\nCompounds of the representative metals with\noxygen exist in three categories (1) oxides, (2)\nperoxides and superoxides, and (3) hydroxides.\nHeating the corresponding hydroxides, nitrates, or\ncarbonates is the most common method for\nproducing oxides. Heating the metal or metal oxide\nin oxygen may lead to the formation of peroxides\nand superoxides. The soluble oxides dissolve in\nwater to form solutions of hydroxides. Most metals\noxides are base anhydrides and react with acids. The\nhydroxides of the representative metals react with\nacids in acid-base reactions to form salts and water.\nThe hydroxides have many commercial uses.\nAll nonmetals except fluorine form multiple oxides.\nNearly all of the nonmetal oxides are acid\nanhydrides. The acidity of oxyacids requires that the\nhydrogen atoms bond to the oxygen atoms in the\nmolecule rather than to the other nonmetal atom.\nGenerally, the strength of the oxyacid increases with\nthe number of oxygen atoms bonded to the\nnonmetal atom and not to a hydrogen.\n18.10 Occurrence, Preparation, and\nProperties of Sulfur\nSulfur (group 16) reacts with almost all metals and\nreadily forms the sulfide ion, S2−, in which it has as\noxidation state of 2−. Sulfur reacts with most\nnonmetals.\n18.11 Occurrence, Preparation, and\nProperties of Halogens\nThe halogens form halides with less electronegative\nelements. Halides of the metals vary from ionic to\ncovalent; halides of nonmetals are covalent.\nInterhalogens form by the combination of two or\nmore different halogens.\nAll of the representative metals react directly with\nelemental halogens or with solutions of the\nhydrohalic acids (HF, HCl, HBr, and HI) to produce\nrepresentative metal halides. Other laboratory\npreparations involve the addition of aqueous\nhydrohalic acids to compounds that contain such\nbasic anions, such as hydroxides, oxides, or\ncarbonates.\n18.12 Occurrence, Preparation, and\nProperties of the Noble Gases\nThe most significant property of the noble gases\n(group 18) is their inactivity. They occur in low\nconcentrations in the atmosphere. They find uses as\ninert atmospheres, neon signs, and as coolants. The\nthree heaviest noble gases react with fluorine to\nform fluorides. The xenon fluorides are the best\ncharacterized as the starting materials for a few\nother noble gas compounds.\nExercises\n18.1 Periodicity\n1.

Thulium, the rarest naturally occurring lanthanoid, is more\ncommon in the earth’s crust than silver (4.5\n10−5% versus 0.79\n10−5% by mass). There are 17 rare\nearth elements, consisting of the 15 lanthanoids plus scandium and yttrium. They are called rare because\nthey were once difficult to extract economically, so it was rare to have a pure sample; due to similar\nchemical properties, it is difficult to separate any one lanthanide from the others. However, newer\nseparation methods, such as ion exchange resins similar to those found in home water softeners, make the\nseparation of these elements easier and more economical. Most ores that contain these elements have low\nconcentrations of all the rare earth elements mixed together.\nThe commercial applications of lanthanides are growing rapidly. For example, europium is important in\nflat screen displays found in computer monitors, cell phones, and televisions. Neodymium is useful in\nlaptop hard drives and in the processes that convert crude oil into gasoline (Figure 19.3). Holmium is found\nin dental and medical equipment. In addition, many alternative energy technologies rely heavily on\nlanthanoids. Neodymium and dysprosium are key components of hybrid vehicle engines and the magnets\nused in wind turbines.\n19.1 • Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Transition Metals and Their Compounds\n937",

          "text": "The transition elements have many properties in common with other metals. They are almost all hard, high-\nmelting solids that conduct heat and electricity well. They readily form alloys and lose electrons to form stable\ncations. In addition, transition metals form a wide variety of stable coordination compounds, in which the\ncentral metal atom or ion acts as a Lewis acid and accepts one or more pairs of electrons. Many different\nmolecules and ions can donate lone pairs to the metal center, serving as Lewis bases. In this chapter, we shall\nfocus primarily on the chemical behavior of the elements of the first transition series.\nProperties of the Transition Elements\nTransition metals demonstrate a wide range of chemical behaviors. As can be seen from their reduction\npotentials (see Appendix H), some transition metals are strong reducing agents, whereas others have very low\nreactivity. For example, the lanthanides all form stable 3+ aqueous cations. The driving force for such\noxidations is similar to that of alkaline earth metals such as Be or Mg, forming Be2+ and Mg2+. On the other\nhand, materials like platinum and gold have much higher reduction potentials. Their ability to resist oxidation\nmakes them useful materials for constructing circuits and jewelry.\nIons of the lighter d-block elements, such as Cr3+, Fe3+, and Co2+, form colorful hydrated ions that are stable in\nwater. However, ions in the period just below these (Mo3+, Ru3+, and Ir2+) are unstable and react readily with\noxygen from the air. The majority of simple, water-stable ions formed by the heavier d-block elements are\noxyanions such as\nand\nRuthenium, osmium, rhodium, iridium, palladium, and platinum are the platinum metals. With difficulty,\nthey form simple cations that are stable in water, and, unlike the earlier elements in the second and third\ntransition series, they do not form stable oxyanions.\nBoth the d- and f-block elements react with nonmetals to form binary compounds; heating is often required.\nThese elements react with halogens to form a variety of halides ranging in oxidation state from 1+ to 6+. On\nheating, oxygen reacts with all of the transition elements except palladium, platinum, silver, and gold. The\noxides of these latter metals can be formed using other reactants, but they decompose upon heating. The\nf-block elements, the elements of group 3, and the elements of the first transition series except copper react\nwith aqueous solutions of acids, forming hydrogen gas and solutions of the corresponding salts.\nFIGURE 19.3\n(a) Europium is used in display screens for televisions, computer monitors, and cell phones. (b)\nNeodymium magnets are commonly found in computer hard drives. (credit b: modification of work by “KUERT\nDatenrettung”/Flickr)\nAs the demand for lanthanide materials has increased faster than supply, prices have also increased. In\n2008, dysprosium cost $110/kg; by 2014, the price had increased to $470/kg. Increasing the supply of\nlanthanoid elements is one of the most significant challenges facing the industries that rely on the optical\nand magnetic properties of these materials.\n938\n19 • Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Some of the observed oxidation\nstates of the elements of the first transition series are shown in Figure 19.4. As we move from left to right\nacross the first transition series, we see that the number of common oxidation states increases at first to a\nmaximum towards the middle of the table, then decreases. The values in the table are typical values; there are\nother known values, and it is possible to synthesize new additions. For example, in 2014, researchers were\nsuccessful in synthesizing a new oxidation state of iridium (9+).\nFIGURE 19.4\nTransition metals of the first transition series can form compounds with varying oxidation states.\nFor the elements scandium through manganese (the first half of the first transition series), the highest\noxidation state corresponds to the loss of all of the electrons in both the s and d orbitals of their valence shells.\nThe titanium(IV) ion, for example, is formed when the titanium atom loses its two 3d and two 4s electrons.\nThese highest oxidation states are the most stable forms of scandium, titanium, and vanadium. However, it is\nnot possible to continue to remove all of the valence electrons from metals as we continue through the series.\nIron is known to form oxidation states from 2+ to 6+, with iron(II) and iron(III) being the most common. Most of\nthe elements of the first transition series form ions with a charge of 2+ or 3+ that are stable in water, although\nthose of the early members of the series can be readily oxidized by air.\nThe elements of the second and third transition series generally are more stable in higher oxidation states\nthan are the elements of the first series. In general, the atomic radius increases down a group, which leads to\nthe ions of the second and third series being larger than are those in the first series. Removing electrons from\norbitals that are located farther from the nucleus is easier than removing electrons close to the nucleus. For\nexample, molybdenum and tungsten, members of group 6, are limited mostly to an oxidation state of 6+ in\naqueous solution. Chromium, the lightest member of the group, forms stable Cr3+ ions in water and, in the\nabsence of air, less stable Cr2+ ions. The sulfide with the highest oxidation state for chromium is Cr2S3, which\ncontains the Cr3+ ion. Molybdenum and tungsten form sulfides in which the metals exhibit oxidation states of\n4+ and 6+.\nEXAMPLE 19.2\nActivity of the Transition Metals\nWhich is the strongest oxidizing agent in acidic solution: dichromate ion, which contains chromium(VI),\npermanganate ion, which contains manganese(VII), or titanium dioxide, which contains titanium(IV)?\nSolution\nFirst, we need to look up the reduction half reactions (in Appendix L) for each oxide in the specified oxidation\nstate:\nA larger reduction potential means that it is easier to reduce the reactant. Permanganate, with the largest\nreduction potential, is the strongest oxidizer under these conditions. Dichromate is next, followed by titanium\ndioxide as the weakest oxidizing agent (the hardest to reduce) of this set.\nCheck Your Learning\nPredict what reaction (if any) will occur between HCl and Co(s), and between HBr and Pt(s).

The time periods in human history known as\nthe Bronze Age and Iron Age mark the advancements in which societies learned to isolate certain metals and\nuse them to make tools and goods. Naturally occurring ores of copper, silver, and gold can contain high\nconcentrations of these metals in elemental form (Figure 19.5). Iron, on the other hand, occurs on earth almost\nexclusively in oxidized forms, such as rust (Fe2O3). The earliest known iron implements were made from iron\nmeteorites. Surviving iron artifacts dating from approximately 4000 to 2500 BC are rare, but all known\nexamples contain specific alloys of iron and nickel that occur only in extraterrestrial objects, not on earth. It\ntook thousands of years of technological advances before civilizations developed iron smelting, the ability to\nextract a pure element from its naturally occurring ores and for iron tools to become common.\nFIGURE 19.5\nTransition metals occur in nature in various forms. Examples include (a) a nugget of copper, (b) a\ndeposit of gold, and (c) an ore containing oxidized iron. (credit a: modification of work by http://images-of-\nelements.com/copper-2.jpg; credit c: modification of work by http://images-of-elements.com/iron-ore.jpg)\nGenerally, the transition elements are extracted from minerals found in a variety of ores. However, the ease of\ntheir recovery varies widely, depending on the concentration of the element in the ore, the identity of the other\nelements present, and the difficulty of reducing the element to the free metal.\nIn general, it is not difficult to reduce ions of the d-block elements to the free element. Carbon is a sufficiently\nstrong reducing agent in most cases. However, like the ions of the more active main group metals, ions of the\nf-block elements must be isolated by electrolysis or by reduction with an active metal such as calcium.\nWe shall discuss the processes used for the isolation of iron, copper, and silver because these three processes\nillustrate the principal means of isolating most of the d-block metals. In general, each of these processes\ninvolves three principal steps: preliminary treatment, smelting, and refining.\n1.\nPreliminary treatment. In general, there is an initial treatment of the ores to make them suitable for the\nextraction of the metals. This usually involves crushing or grinding the ore, concentrating the metal-\nbearing components, and sometimes treating these substances chemically to convert them into\ncompounds that are easier to reduce to the metal.\n2.\nSmelting. The next step is the extraction of the metal in the molten state, a process called smelting, which\nincludes reduction of the metallic compound to the metal. Impurities may be removed by the addition of a\ncompound that forms a slag—a substance with a low melting point that can be readily separated from the\nmolten metal.\n3.\nRefining. The final step in the recovery of a metal is refining the metal. Low boiling metals such as zinc and\nmercury can be refined by distillation. When fused on an inclined table, low melting metals like tin flow\naway from higher-melting impurities. Electrolysis is another common method for refining metals.\n940\n19 • Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

          "text": "Isolation of Iron\nThe early application of iron to the manufacture of tools and weapons was possible because of the wide\ndistribution of iron ores and the ease with which iron compounds in the ores could be reduced by carbon. For a\nlong time, charcoal was the form of carbon used in the reduction process. The production and use of iron\nbecame much more widespread about 1620, when coke was introduced as the reducing agent. Coke is a form\nof carbon formed by heating coal in the absence of air to remove impurities.\nThe first step in the metallurgy of iron is usually roasting the ore (heating the ore in air) to remove water,\ndecomposing carbonates into oxides, and converting sulfides into oxides. The oxides are then reduced in a\nblast furnace that is 80–100 feet high and about 25 feet in diameter (Figure 19.6) in which the roasted ore,\ncoke, and limestone (impure CaCO3) are introduced continuously into the top. Molten iron and slag are\nwithdrawn at the bottom. The entire stock in a furnace may weigh several hundred tons.\nFIGURE 19.6\nWithin a blast furnace, different reactions occur in different temperature zones. Carbon monoxide is\ngenerated in the hotter bottom regions and rises upward to reduce the iron oxides to pure iron through a series of\nreactions that take place in the upper regions.\nNear the bottom of a furnace are nozzles through which preheated air is blown into the furnace. As soon as the\nair enters, the coke in the region of the nozzles is oxidized to carbon dioxide with the liberation of a great deal\nof heat. The hot carbon dioxide passes upward through the overlying layer of white-hot coke, where it is\nreduced to carbon monoxide:\nThe carbon monoxide serves as the reducing agent in the upper regions of the furnace. The individual\nreactions are indicated in Figure 19.6.\nThe iron oxides are reduced in the upper region of the furnace. In the middle region, limestone (calcium\ncarbonate) decomposes, and the resulting calcium oxide combines with silica and silicates in the ore to form\n19.1 • Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Transition Metals and Their Compounds\n941",

The slag is mostly calcium silicate and contains most of the commercially unimportant components of\nthe ore:\nJust below the middle of the furnace, the temperature is high enough to melt both the iron and the slag. They\ncollect in layers at the bottom of the furnace; the less dense slag floats on the iron and protects it from\noxidation. Several times a day, the slag and molten iron are withdrawn from the furnace. The iron is\ntransferred to casting machines or to a steelmaking plant (Figure 19.7).\nFIGURE 19.7\nMolten iron is shown being cast as steel. (credit: Clint Budd)\nMuch of the iron produced is refined and converted into steel. Steel is made from iron by removing impurities\nand adding substances such as manganese, chromium, nickel, tungsten, molybdenum, and vanadium to\nproduce alloys with properties that make the material suitable for specific uses. Most steels also contain small\nbut definite percentages of carbon (0.04%–2.5%).

The remaining mixture, which consists of Cu2S, FeS, FeO, and SiO2, is mixed with limestone, which\nserves as a flux (a material that aids in the removal of impurities), and heated. Molten slag forms as the iron\nand silica are removed by Lewis acid-base reactions:\nIn these reactions, the silicon dioxide behaves as a Lewis acid, which accepts a pair of electrons from the Lewis\nbase (the oxide ion).\nReduction of the Cu2S that remains after smelting is accomplished by blowing air through the molten material.\n942\n19 • Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

At\none time, panning was an effective method of isolating both silver and gold nuggets. Due to their low reactivity,\nthese metals, and a few others, occur in deposits as nuggets. The discovery of platinum was due to Spanish\nexplorers in Central America mistaking platinum nuggets for silver. When the metal is not in the form of\nnuggets, it often useful to employ a process called hydrometallurgy to separate silver from its ores.

In their lower\noxidation states, the transition elements form ionic compounds; in their higher oxidation states, they form\ncovalent compounds or polyatomic ions. The variation in oxidation states exhibited by the transition elements\ngives these compounds a metal-based, oxidation-reduction chemistry.

The other halogens may\nnot form analogous compounds.\nIn general, the preparation of stable water solutions of the halides of the metals of the first transition series is\nby the addition of a hydrohalic acid to carbonates, hydroxides, oxides, or other compounds that contain basic\nanions. Sample reactions are:\nMost of the first transition series metals also dissolve in acids, forming a solution of the salt and hydrogen gas.\nFor example:\nThe polarity of bonds with transition metals varies based not only upon the electronegativities of the atoms\ninvolved but also upon the oxidation state of the transition metal. Remember that bond polarity is a continuous\nspectrum with electrons being shared evenly (covalent bonds) at one extreme and electrons being transferred\ncompletely (ionic bonds) at the other. No bond is ever 100% ionic, and the degree to which the electrons are\nevenly distributed determines many properties of the compound. Transition metal halides with low oxidation\nnumbers form more ionic bonds. For example, titanium(II) chloride and titanium(III) chloride (TiCl2 and TiCl3)\nhave high melting points that are characteristic of ionic compounds, but titanium(IV) chloride (TiCl4) is a\nvolatile liquid, consistent with having covalent titanium-chlorine bonds. All halides of the heavier d-block\nelements have significant covalent characteristics.\nThe covalent behavior of the transition metals with higher oxidation states is exemplified by the reaction of the\nmetal tetrahalides with water. Like covalent silicon tetrachloride, both the titanium and vanadium tetrahalides\nreact with water to give solutions containing the corresponding hydrohalic acids and the metal oxides:\nOxides\nAs with the halides, the nature of bonding in oxides of the transition elements is determined by the oxidation\nstate of the metal. Oxides with low oxidation states tend to be more ionic, whereas those with higher oxidation\nstates are more covalent. These variations in bonding are because the electronegativities of the elements are\nnot fixed values. The electronegativity of an element increases with increasing oxidation state. Transition\nmetals in low oxidation states have lower electronegativity values than oxygen; therefore, these metal oxides\nare ionic. Transition metals in very high oxidation states have electronegativity values close to that of oxygen,\nwhich leads to these oxides being covalent.\nThe oxides of the first transition series can be prepared by heating the metals in air. These oxides are Sc2O3,\nTiO2, V2O5, Cr2O3, Mn3O4, Fe3O4, Co3O4, NiO, and CuO.\nAlternatively, these oxides and other oxides (with the metals in different oxidation states) can be produced by\nheating the corresponding hydroxides, carbonates, or oxalates in an inert atmosphere. Iron(II) oxide can be\nprepared by heating iron(II) oxalate, and cobalt(II) oxide is produced by heating cobalt(II) hydroxide:\nWith the exception of CrO3 and Mn2O7, transition metal oxides are not soluble in water. They can react with\nacids and, in a few cases, with bases. Overall, oxides of transition metals with the lowest oxidation states are\nbasic (and react with acids), the intermediate ones are amphoteric, and the highest oxidation states are\n19.1 • Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Transition Metals and Their Compounds\n945",

Vanadium(V) oxide, chromium(VI) oxide, and manganese(VII) oxide are acidic.

For example, adding a solution of sodium hydroxide to a solution of\ncobalt sulfate produces a gelatinous pink or blue precipitate of cobalt(II) hydroxide. The net ionic equation is:\nIn this and many other cases, these precipitates are hydroxides containing the transition metal ion, hydroxide\nions, and water coordinated to the transition metal. In other cases, the precipitates are hydrated oxides\ncomposed of the metal ion, oxide ions, and water of hydration:\nThese substances do not contain hydroxide ions. However, both the hydroxides and the hydrated oxides react\nwith acids to form salts and water. When precipitating a metal from solution, it is necessary to avoid an excess\nof hydroxide ion, as this may lead to complex ion formation as discussed later in this chapter. The precipitated\nmetal hydroxides can be separated for further processing or for waste disposal.\nCarbonates\nMany of the elements of the first transition series form insoluble carbonates. It is possible to prepare these\ncarbonates by the addition of a soluble carbonate salt to a solution of a transition metal salt. For example,\nnickel carbonate can be prepared from solutions of nickel nitrate and sodium carbonate according to the\nfollowing net ionic equation:\nThe reactions of the transition metal carbonates are similar to those of the active metal carbonates. They react\nwith acids to form metals salts, carbon dioxide, and water. Upon heating, they decompose, forming the\ntransition metal oxides.\nOther Salts\nIn many respects, the chemical behavior of the elements of the first transition series is very similar to that of\nthe main group metals. In particular, the same types of reactions that are used to prepare salts of the main\ngroup metals can be used to prepare simple ionic salts of these elements.\nA variety of salts can be prepared from metals that are more active than hydrogen by reaction with the\ncorresponding acids: Scandium metal reacts with hydrobromic acid to form a solution of scandium bromide:\nThe common compounds that we have just discussed can also be used to prepare salts.

This lack of resistance means\nthat there is no energy loss during the transmission of electricity. This would lead to a significant reduction in\nthe cost of electricity.\nMost currently used, commercial superconducting materials, such as NbTi and Nb3Sn, do not become\nsuperconducting until they are cooled below 23 K (−250 °C). This requires the use of liquid helium, which has a\nboiling temperature of 4 K and is expensive and difficult to handle. The cost of liquid helium has deterred the\nwidespread application of superconductors.\nOne of the most exciting scientific discoveries of the 1980s was the characterization of compounds that exhibit\nsuperconductivity at temperatures above 90 K. (Compared to liquid helium, 90 K is a high temperature.)\nTypical among the high-temperature superconducting materials are oxides containing yttrium (or one of\nseveral rare earth elements), barium, and copper in a 1:2:3 ratio. The formula of the ionic yttrium compound is\nYBa2Cu3O7.\nThe new materials become superconducting at temperatures close to 90 K (Figure 19.10), temperatures that\ncan be reached by cooling with liquid nitrogen (boiling temperature of 77 K). Not only are liquid nitrogen-\ncooled materials easier to handle, but the cooling costs are also about 1000 times lower than for liquid helium.\nFurther advances during the same period included materials that became superconducting at even higher\ntemperatures and with a wider array of materials. The DuPont team led by Uma Chowdry and Arthur Sleight\nidentified Bismouth-Strontium-Copper-Oxides that became superconducting at temperatures as high as 110 K\nand, importantly, did not contain rare earth elements. Advances continued through the subsequent decades\nuntil, in 2020, a team led by Ranga Dias at University of Rochester announced the development of a room-\ntemperature superconductor, opening doors to widespread applications. More research and development is\nneeded to realize the potential of these materials, but the possibilities are very promising.\nFIGURE 19.10\nThe resistance of the high-temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O7 varies with temperature.

For instance, the four valence electrons of carbon overlap\nwith electrons from four hydrogen atoms to form CH4. The one valence electron leaves sodium and adds to the\nseven valence electrons of chlorine to form the ionic formula unit NaCl (Figure 19.13). Transition metals do not\nnormally bond in this fashion. They primarily form coordinate covalent bonds, a form of the Lewis acid-base\ninteraction in which both of the electrons in the bond are contributed by a donor (Lewis base) to an electron\nacceptor (Lewis acid). The Lewis acid in coordination complexes, often called a central metal ion (or atom), is\noften a transition metal or inner transition metal, although main group elements can also form coordination\ncompounds. The Lewis base donors, called ligands, can be a wide variety of chemicals—atoms, molecules, or\nions. The only requirement is that they have one or more electron pairs, which can be donated to the central\nmetal. Most often, this involves a donor atom with a lone pair of electrons that can form a coordinate bond to\nthe metal.\nFIGURE 19.13\n(a) Covalent bonds involve the sharing of electrons, and ionic bonds involve the transferring of\nelectrons associated with each bonding atom, as indicated by the colored electrons. (b) However, coordinate\ncovalent bonds involve electrons from a Lewis base being donated to a metal center. The lone pairs from six water\nmolecules form bonds to the scandium ion to form an octahedral complex. (Only the donated pairs are shown.)\nThe coordination sphere consists of the central metal ion or atom plus its attached ligands. Brackets in a\nformula enclose the coordination sphere; species outside the brackets are not part of the coordination sphere.\nThe coordination number of the central metal ion or atom is the number of donor atoms bonded to it. The\ncoordination number for the silver ion in [Ag(NH3)2]+ is two (Figure 19.14). For the copper(II) ion in [CuCl4]2−,\nthe coordination number is four, whereas for the cobalt(II) ion in [Co(H2O)6]2+ the coordination number is six.\nEach of these ligands is monodentate, from the Greek for “one toothed,” meaning that they connect with the\ncentral metal through only one atom. In this case, the number of ligands and the coordination number are\nequal.\n19.2 • Coordination Chemistry of Transition Metals\n949",

Bidentate ligands are those in which\ntwo atoms coordinate to the metal center. For example, ethylenediamine (en, H2NCH2CH2NH2) contains two\nnitrogen atoms, each of which has a lone pair and can serve as a Lewis base (Figure 19.15).

Transition metal complexes\noften exist as geometric isomers, in which the same atoms are connected through the same types of bonds but\nwith differences in their orientation in space. Coordination complexes with two different ligands in the cis and\ntrans positions from a ligand of interest form isomers. For example, the octahedral [Co(NH3)4Cl2]+ ion has two\nisomers. In the cis configuration, the two chloride ligands are adjacent to each other (Figure 19.21). The other\nisomer, the trans configuration, has the two chloride ligands directly across from one another.\nFIGURE 19.21\nThe cis and trans isomers of [Co(H2O)4Cl2]+ contain the same ligands attached to the same metal\nion, but the spatial arrangement causes these two compounds to have very different properties.\nDifferent geometric isomers of a substance are different chemical compounds. They exhibit different\nproperties, even though they have the same formula. For example, the two isomers of [Co(NH3)4Cl2]NO3 differ\nin color; the cis form is violet, and the trans form is green. Furthermore, these isomers have different dipole\nmoments, solubilities, and reactivities. As an example of how the arrangement in space can influence the\nmolecular properties, consider the polarity of the two [Co(NH3)4Cl2]NO3 isomers. Remember that the polarity\nof a molecule or ion is determined by the bond dipoles (which are due to the difference in electronegativity of\nthe bonding atoms) and their arrangement in space. In one isomer, cis chloride ligands cause more electron\ndensity on one side of the molecule than on the other, making it polar. For the trans isomer, each ligand is\ndirectly across from an identical ligand, so the bond dipoles cancel out, and the molecule is nonpolar.\nEXAMPLE 19.5\nGeometric Isomers\nIdentify which geometric isomer of [Pt(NH3)2Cl2] is shown in Figure 19.20.

This means that optical isomers are\nnonsuperimposable mirror images. A classic example of this is a pair of hands, in which the right and left hand\nare mirror images of one another but cannot be superimposed. Optical isomers are very important in organic\nand biochemistry because living systems often incorporate one specific optical isomer and not the other.\nUnlike geometric isomers, pairs of optical isomers have identical properties (boiling point, polarity, solubility,\netc.). Optical isomers differ only in the way they affect polarized light and how they react with other optical\nisomers. For coordination complexes, many coordination compounds such as [M(en)3]n+ [in which Mn+ is a\ncentral metal ion such as iron(III) or cobalt(II)] form enantiomers, as shown in Figure 19.23. These two isomers\nwill react differently with other optical isomers. For example, DNA helices are optical isomers, and the form\nthat occurs in nature (right-handed DNA) will bind to only one isomer of [M(en)3]n+ and not the other.\nFIGURE 19.23\nThe complex [M(en)3]n+ (Mn+ = a metal ion, en = ethylenediamine) has a nonsuperimposable mirror\nimage.\nThe [Co(en)2Cl2]+ ion exhibits geometric isomerism (cis/trans), and its cis isomer exists as a pair of optical\nisomers (Figure 19.24).\nFIGURE 19.24\nThree isomeric forms of [Co(en)2Cl2]+ exist. The trans isomer, formed when the chlorines are\npositioned at a 180° angle, has very different properties from the cis isomers. The mirror images of the cis isomer\nform a pair of optical isomers, which have identical behavior except when reacting with other enantiomers.\nLinkage isomers occur when the coordination compound contains a ligand that can bind to the transition\nmetal center through two different atoms. For example, the CN ligand can bind through the carbon atom\n(cyano) or through the nitrogen atom (isocyano). Similarly, SCN− can be bound through the sulfur or nitrogen\n956\n19 • Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

As you recall from the\nchapter on kinetics, a catalyst increases the rate of reaction by lowering the activation energy and is\nregenerated in the catalytic cycle. Over 90% of all manufactured products are made with the aid of one or\nmore catalysts. The ability to bind ligands and change oxidation states makes transition metal catalysts\nwell suited for catalytic applications. Vanadium oxide is used to produce 230,000,000 tons of sulfuric acid\nworldwide each year, which in turn is used to make everything from fertilizers to cans for food. Plastics are\nmade with the aid of transition metal catalysts, along with detergents, fertilizers, paints, and more (see\nFigure 19.26). Very complicated pharmaceuticals are manufactured with catalysts that are selective,\nreacting with one specific bond out of a large number of possibilities. Catalysts allow processes to be more\neconomical and more environmentally friendly. Developing new catalysts and better understanding of\nexisting systems are important areas of current research.\n19.2 • Coordination Chemistry of Transition Metals\n957",

When metal ions are reduced to produce thin metal\ncoatings, metals can clump together to form clusters and nanoparticles. When metal coordination complexes\nare used, the ligands keep the metal atoms isolated from each other. It has been found that many metals plate\nout as a smoother, more uniform, better-looking, and more adherent surface when plated from a bath\ncontaining the metal as a complex ion. Thus, complexes such as [Ag(CN)2]−and [Au(CN)2]−are used extensively\nin the electroplating industry.\nIn 1965, scientists at Michigan State University discovered that there was a platinum complex that inhibited\ncell division in certain microorganisms. Later work showed that the complex was\ncis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), [Pt(NH3)2(Cl)2], and that the trans isomer was not effective. The inhibition\nof cell division indicated that this square planar compound could be an anticancer agent. In 1978, the US Food\nand Drug Administration approved this compound, known as cisplatin, for use in the treatment of certain\nforms of cancer. Since that time, many similar platinum compounds have been developed for the treatment of\ncancer. In all cases, these are the cis isomers and never the trans isomers. The diammine (NH3)2 portion is\nretained with other groups, replacing the dichloro [(Cl)2] portion. The newer drugs include carboplatin,\noxaliplatin, and satraplatin.\n19.3 Spectroscopic and Magnetic Properties of Coordination Compounds\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nOutline the basic premise of crystal field theory (CFT)\n•\nIdentify molecular geometries associated with various d-orbital splitting patterns\n•\nPredict electron configurations of split d orbitals for selected transition metal atoms or ions\n•\nExplain spectral and magnetic properties in terms of CFT concepts\nThe behavior of coordination compounds cannot be adequately explained by the same theories used for main\ngroup element chemistry. The observed geometries of coordination complexes are not consistent with\nhybridized orbitals on the central metal overlapping with ligand orbitals, as would be predicted by valence\nbond theory. The observed colors indicate that the d orbitals often occur at different energy levels rather than\nall being degenerate, that is, of equal energy, as are the three p orbitals. To explain the stabilities, structures,\ncolors, and magnetic properties of transition metal complexes, a different bonding model has been developed.\nJust as valence bond theory explains many aspects of bonding in main group chemistry, crystal field theory is\nuseful in understanding and predicting the behavior of transition metal complexes.\nCrystal Field Theory\nTo explain the observed behavior of transition metal complexes (such as how colors arise), a model involving\nelectrostatic interactions between the electrons from the ligands and the electrons in the unhybridized d\norbitals of the central metal atom has been developed. This electrostatic model is crystal field theory (CFT). It\nallows us to understand, interpret, and predict the colors, magnetic behavior, and some structures of\ncoordination compounds of transition metals.\nCFT focuses on the nonbonding electrons on the central metal ion in coordination complexes not on the metal-\nligand bonds. Like valence bond theory, CFT tells only part of the story of the behavior of complexes. However,\nit tells the part that valence bond theory does not. In its pure form, CFT ignores any covalent bonding between\nligands and metal ions. Both the ligand and the metal are treated as infinitesimally small point charges.\nAll electrons are negative, so the electrons donated from the ligands will repel the electrons of the central\nmetal. Let us consider the behavior of the electrons in the unhybridized d orbitals in an octahedral complex.\nThe five d orbitals consist of lobe-shaped regions and are arranged in space, as shown in Figure 19.33. In an\noctahedral complex, the six ligands coordinate along the axes.\n962\n19 • Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

The ligands (L) coordinate along the axes. For clarity, the ligands have been omitted from\nthe\norbital so that the axis labels could be shown.\nIn an uncomplexed metal ion in the gas phase, the electrons are distributed among the five d orbitals in accord\nwith Hund's rule because the orbitals all have the same energy. However, when ligands coordinate to a metal\nion, the energies of the d orbitals are no longer the same.\nIn octahedral complexes, the lobes in two of the five d orbitals, the\nand\norbitals, point toward the\nligands (Figure 19.33). These two orbitals are called the eg orbitals (the symbol actually refers to the symmetry\nof the orbitals, but we will use it as a convenient name for these two orbitals in an octahedral complex). The\nother three orbitals, the dxy, dxz, and dyz orbitals, have lobes that point between the ligands and are called the\nt2g orbitals (again, the symbol really refers to the symmetry of the orbitals). As six ligands approach the metal\nion along the axes of the octahedron, their point charges repel the electrons in the d orbitals of the metal ion.\nHowever, the repulsions between the electrons in the eg orbitals (the\nand\norbitals) and the ligands\nare greater than the repulsions between the electrons in the t2g orbitals (the dzy, dxz, and dyz orbitals) and the\nligands. This is because the lobes of the eg orbitals point directly at the ligands, whereas the lobes of the t2g\norbitals point between them. Thus, electrons in the eg orbitals of the metal ion in an octahedral complex have\nhigher potential energies than those of electrons in the t2g orbitals. The difference in energy may be\nrepresented as shown in Figure 19.34.\nFIGURE 19.34\nIn octahedral complexes, the eg orbitals are destabilized (higher in energy) compared to the t2g\norbitals because the ligands interact more strongly with the d orbitals at which they are pointed directly.\nThe difference in energy between the eg and the t2g orbitals is called the crystal field splitting and is\nsymbolized by Δoct, where oct stands for octahedral.\nThe magnitude of Δoct depends on many factors, including the nature of the six ligands located around the\ncentral metal ion, the charge on the metal, and whether the metal is using 3d, 4d, or 5d orbitals. Different\nligands produce different crystal field splittings. The increasing crystal field splitting produced by ligands is\nexpressed in the spectrochemical series, a short version of which is given here:\n19.3 • Spectroscopic and Magnetic Properties of Coordination Compounds\n963",

          "text": "In this series, ligands on the left cause small crystal field splittings and are weak-field ligands, whereas those\non the right cause larger splittings and are strong-field ligands. Thus, the Δoct value for an octahedral complex\nwith iodide ligands (I−) is much smaller than the Δoct value for the same metal with cyanide ligands (CN−).\nElectrons in the d orbitals follow the aufbau (“filling up”) principle, which says that the orbitals will be filled to\ngive the lowest total energy, just as in main group chemistry. When two electrons occupy the same orbital, the\nlike charges repel each other. The energy needed to pair up two electrons in a single orbital is called the\npairing energy (P). Electrons will always singly occupy each orbital in a degenerate set before pairing. P is\nsimilar in magnitude to Δoct. When electrons fill the d orbitals, the relative magnitudes of Δoct and P determine\nwhich orbitals will be occupied.\nIn [Fe(CN)6]4−, the strong field of six cyanide ligands produces a large Δoct. Under these conditions, the\nelectrons require less energy to pair than they require to be excited to the eg orbitals (Δoct > P). The six 3d\nelectrons of the Fe2+ ion pair in the three t2g orbitals (Figure 19.35). Complexes in which the electrons are\npaired because of the large crystal field splitting are called low-spin complexes because the number of\nunpaired electrons (spins) is minimized.\nFIGURE 19.35\nIron(II) complexes have six electrons in the 5d orbitals. In the absence of a crystal field, the\norbitals are degenerate. For coordination complexes with strong-field ligands such as [Fe(CN)6]4−, Δoct is greater\nthan P, and the electrons pair in the lower energy t2g orbitals before occupying the eg orbitals. With weak-field\nligands such as H2O, the ligand field splitting is less than the pairing energy, Δoct less than P, so the electrons occupy\nall d orbitals singly before any pairing occurs.\nIn [Fe(H2O)6]2+, on the other hand, the weak field of the water molecules produces only a small crystal field\nsplitting (Δoct < P). Because it requires less energy for the electrons to occupy the eg orbitals than to pair\ntogether, there will be an electron in each of the five 3d orbitals before pairing occurs. For the six d electrons on\nthe iron(II) center in [Fe(H2O)6]2+, there will be one pair of electrons and four unpaired electrons (Figure\n19.35). Complexes such as the [Fe(H2O)6]2+ ion, in which the electrons are unpaired because the crystal field\nsplitting is not large enough to cause them to pair, are called high-spin complexes because the number of\nunpaired electrons (spins) is maximized.\nA similar line of reasoning shows why the [Fe(CN)6]3−ion is a low-spin complex with only one unpaired\nelectron, whereas both the [Fe(H2O)6]3+ and [FeF6]3−ions are high-spin complexes with five unpaired electrons.\nEXAMPLE 19.7\nHigh- and Low-Spin Complexes\nPredict the number of unpaired electrons.\n(a) K3[CrI6]\n(b) [Cu(en)2(H2O)2]Cl2\n964\n19 • Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Paramagnetic\nsubstances are attracted to magnetic fields. Many transition metal complexes have unpaired electrons and\nhence are paramagnetic. Molecules such as N2 and ions such as Na+ and [Fe(CN)6]4−that contain no unpaired\nelectrons are diamagnetic. Diamagnetic substances have a slight tendency to be repelled by magnetic fields.\nWhen an electron in an atom or ion is unpaired, the magnetic moment due to its spin makes the entire atom or\nion paramagnetic. The size of the magnetic moment of a system containing unpaired electrons is related\ndirectly to the number of such electrons: the greater the number of unpaired electrons, the larger the magnetic\nmoment. Therefore, the observed magnetic moment is used to determine the number of unpaired electrons\npresent. The measured magnetic moment of low-spin d6 [Fe(CN)6]4−confirms that iron is diamagnetic,\n19.3 • Spectroscopic and Magnetic Properties of Coordination Compounds\n967",

For many main group atoms and molecules, the absorbed photons are in the ultraviolet range of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum, which cannot be detected by the human eye. For coordination compounds, the\nenergy difference between the d orbitals often allows photons in the visible range to be absorbed.\nThe human eye perceives a mixture of all the colors, in the proportions present in sunlight, as white light.\nComplementary colors, those located across from each other on a color wheel, are also used in color vision.\nThe eye perceives a mixture of two complementary colors, in the proper proportions, as white light. Likewise,\nwhen a color is missing from white light, the eye sees its complement. For example, when red photons are\nabsorbed from white light, the eyes see the color green. When violet photons are removed from white light, the\neyes see lemon yellow. The blue color of the [Cu(NH3)4]2+ ion results because this ion absorbs orange and red\nlight, leaving the complementary colors of blue and green (Figure 19.37).\nFIGURE 19.37\n(a) An object is black if it absorbs all colors of light. If it reflects all colors of light, it is white. An\nobject has a color if it absorbs all colors except one, such as this yellow strip. The strip also appears yellow if it\nabsorbs the complementary color from white light (in this case, indigo).

Therefore, the colors of coordination compounds depend on many\nfactors. As shown in Figure 19.38, different aqueous metal ions can have different colors. In addition, different\noxidation states of one metal can produce different colors, as shown for the vanadium complexes in the link\nbelow.\nFIGURE 19.38\nThe partially filled d orbitals of the stable ions Cr3+(aq), Fe3+(aq), and Co2+(aq) (left, center and\nright, respectively) give rise to various colors. (credit: Sahar Atwa)\nThe specific ligands coordinated to the metal center also influence the color of coordination complexes. For\nexample, the iron(II) complex [Fe(H2O)6]SO4 appears blue-green because the high-spin complex absorbs\nphotons in the red wavelengths (Figure 19.39).

Transition metal coordination compounds with these ligands are yellow, orange, or red because they\nabsorb higher-energy violet or blue light.

The reactivity of the transition elements varies\nwidely from very active metals such as scandium\nand iron to almost inert elements, such as the\nplatinum metals. The type of chemistry used in the\nisolation of the elements from their ores depends\nupon the concentration of the element in its ore and\nthe difficulty of reducing ions of the elements to the\nmetals. Metals that are more active are more difficult\nto reduce.\nTransition metals exhibit chemical behavior typical\nof metals. For example, they oxidize in air upon\nheating and react with elemental halogens to form\nhalides. Those elements that lie above hydrogen in\nthe activity series react with acids, producing salts\nand hydrogen gas. Oxides, hydroxides, and\ncarbonates of transition metal compounds in low\noxidation states are basic. Halides and other salts\nare generally stable in water, although oxygen must\nbe excluded in some cases. Most transition metals\nform a variety of stable oxidation states, allowing\nthem to demonstrate a wide range of chemical\nreactivity.\n19.2 Coordination Chemistry of Transition\nMetals\nThe transition elements and main group elements\ncan form coordination compounds, or complexes, in\nwhich a central metal atom or ion is bonded to one\nor more ligands by coordinate covalent bonds.\nLigands with more than one donor atom are called\npolydentate ligands and form chelates. The common\ngeometries found in complexes are tetrahedral and\nsquare planar (both with a coordination number of\nfour) and octahedral (with a coordination number of\nsix). Cis and trans configurations are possible in\nsome octahedral and square planar complexes. In\naddition to these geometrical isomers, optical\nisomers (molecules or ions that are mirror images\nbut not superimposable) are possible in certain\noctahedral complexes. Coordination complexes have\na wide variety of uses including oxygen transport in\nblood, water purification, and pharmaceutical use.\n19.3 Spectroscopic and Magnetic Properties\nof Coordination Compounds\nCrystal field theory treats interactions between the\nelectrons on the metal and the ligands as a simple\nelectrostatic effect. The presence of the ligands near\nthe metal ion changes the energies of the metal d\norbitals relative to their energies in the free ion. Both\nthe color and the magnetic properties of a complex\ncan be attributed to this crystal field splitting. The\nmagnitude of the splitting (Δoct) depends on the\nnature of the ligands bonded to the metal. Strong-\nfield ligands produce large splitting and favor low-\nspin complexes, in which the t2g orbitals are\ncompletely filled before any electrons occupy the eg\norbitals. Weak-field ligands favor formation of high-\nspin complexes. The t2g and the eg orbitals are singly\noccupied before any are doubly occupied.\n972\n19 • Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

The prevalence of carbon\ncompounds in living things has led to the epithet “carbon-based” life. The truth is we know of no other kind of\nlife. Early chemists regarded substances isolated from organisms (plants and animals) as a different type of\nmatter that could not be synthesized artificially, and these substances were thus known as organic\ncompounds. The widespread belief called vitalism held that organic compounds were formed by a vital force\npresent only in living organisms. The German chemist Friedrich Wohler was one of the early chemists to refute\nthis aspect of vitalism, when, in 1828, he reported the synthesis of urea, a component of many body fluids,\nfrom nonliving materials. Since then, it has been recognized that organic molecules obey the same natural\nlaws as inorganic substances, and the category of organic compounds has evolved to include both natural and\nsynthetic compounds that contain carbon. Some carbon-containing compounds are not classified as organic,\nfor example, carbonates and cyanides, and simple oxides, such as CO and CO2. Although a single, precise\ndefinition has yet to be identified by the chemistry community, most agree that a defining trait of organic\nmolecules is the presence of carbon as the principal element, bonded to hydrogen and other carbon atoms.\nToday, organic compounds are key components of plastics, soaps, perfumes, sweeteners, fabrics,\npharmaceuticals, and many other substances that we use every day. The value to us of organic compounds\nensures that organic chemistry is an important discipline within the general field of chemistry. In this chapter,\nwe discuss why the element carbon gives rise to a vast number and variety of compounds, how those\ncompounds are classified, and the role of organic compounds in representative biological and industrial\nsettings.\nFigure 20.1\nAll organic compounds contain carbon and most are formed by living things, although they are also\nformed by geological and artificial processes.

The number of potential organic\ncompounds has been estimated2 at 1060—an astronomically high number. The existence of so many organic\nmolecules is a consequence of the ability of carbon atoms to form up to four strong bonds to other carbon\natoms, resulting in chains and rings of many different sizes, shapes, and complexities.\nThe simplest organic compounds contain only the elements carbon and hydrogen, and are called\nhydrocarbons. Even though they are composed of only two types of atoms, there is a wide variety of\nhydrocarbons because they may consist of varying lengths of chains, branched chains, and rings of carbon\natoms, or combinations of these structures. In addition, hydrocarbons may differ in the types of carbon-carbon\nbonds present in their molecules. Many hydrocarbons are found in plants, animals, and their fossils; other\nhydrocarbons have been prepared in the laboratory. We use hydrocarbons every day, mainly as fuels, such as\nnatural gas, acetylene, propane, butane, and the principal components of gasoline, diesel fuel, and heating oil.\nThe familiar plastics polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene are also hydrocarbons. We can distinguish\nseveral types of hydrocarbons by differences in the bonding between carbon atoms. This leads to differences\nin geometries and in the hybridization of the carbon orbitals.\nAlkanes\nAlkanes, or saturated hydrocarbons, contain only single covalent bonds between carbon atoms. Each of the\ncarbon atoms in an alkane has sp3 hybrid orbitals and is bonded to four other atoms, each of which is either\ncarbon or hydrogen. The Lewis structures and models of methane, ethane, and pentane are illustrated in\nFigure 20.2. Carbon chains are usually drawn as straight lines in Lewis structures, but one has to remember\nthat Lewis structures are not intended to indicate the geometry of molecules. Notice that the carbon atoms in\nthe structural models (the ball-and-stick and space-filling models) of the pentane molecule do not lie in a\nstraight line. Because of the sp3 hybridization, the bond angles in carbon chains are close to 109.5°, giving\nsuch chains in an alkane a zigzag shape.\nThe structures of alkanes and other organic molecules may also be represented in a less detailed manner by\ncondensed structural formulas (or simply, condensed formulas). Instead of the usual format for chemical\nformulas in which each element symbol appears just once, a condensed formula is written to suggest the\nbonding in the molecule. These formulas have the appearance of a Lewis structure from which most or all of\nthe bond symbols have been removed. Condensed structural formulas for ethane and pentane are shown at\nthe bottom of Figure 20.2, and several additional examples are provided in the exercises at the end of this\nchapter.\n1\nThis is the Beilstein database, now available through the Reaxys site (www.elsevier.com/online-tools/reaxys).\n2\nPeplow, Mark. “Organic Synthesis: The Robo-Chemist,” Nature 512 (2014): 20–2.\n978\n20 • Organic Chemistry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

The nomenclature for alkanes is based on two rules:\n1.\nTo name an alkane, first identify the longest chain of carbon atoms in its structure. A two-carbon chain is\ncalled ethane; a three-carbon chain, propane; and a four-carbon chain, butane. Longer chains are named\nas follows: pentane (five-carbon chain), hexane (6), heptane (7), octane (8), nonane (9), and decane (10).\nThese prefixes can be seen in the names of the alkanes described in Table 20.1.\n2.\nAdd prefixes to the name of the longest chain to indicate the positions and names of substituents.\nSubstituents are branches or functional groups that replace hydrogen atoms on a chain. The position of a\nsubstituent or branch is identified by the number of the carbon atom it is bonded to in the chain. We\nnumber the carbon atoms in the chain by counting from the end of the chain nearest the substituents.\nMultiple substituents are named individually and placed in alphabetical order at the front of the name.\nWhen more than one substituent is present, either on the same carbon atom or on different carbon atoms, the\nsubstituents are listed alphabetically. Because the carbon atom numbering begins at the end closest to a\nsubstituent, the longest chain of carbon atoms is numbered in such a way as to produce the lowest number for\nthe substituents. The ending -o replaces -ide at the end of the name of an electronegative substituent (in ionic\ncompounds, the negatively charged ion ends with -ide like chloride; in organic compounds, such atoms are\ntreated as substituents and the -o ending is used). The number of substituents of the same type is indicated by\nthe prefixes di- (two), tri- (three), tetra- (four), and so on (for example, difluoro- indicates two fluoride\nsubstituents).\n20.1 • Hydrocarbons\n983",

You have likely heard of unsaturated fats. These are complex organic molecules with long chains\nof carbon atoms, which contain at least one double bond between carbon atoms. Unsaturated hydrocarbon\nmolecules that contain one or more double bonds are called alkenes. Carbon atoms linked by a double bond\nare bound together by two bonds, one σ bond and one π bond. Double and triple bonds give rise to a different\ngeometry around the carbon atom that participates in them, leading to important differences in molecular\nshape and properties. The differing geometries are responsible for the different properties of unsaturated\nversus saturated fats.\nEthene, C2H4, is the simplest alkene.

Over 135 million tons of ethylene were produced worldwide in 2010 for use\nin the polymer, petrochemical, and plastic industries. Ethylene is produced industrially in a process called\ncracking, in which the long hydrocarbon chains in a petroleum mixture are broken into smaller molecules.\nChemistry in Everyday Life\nRecycling Plastics\nPolymers (from Greek words poly meaning “many” and mer meaning “parts”) are large molecules made up\nof repeating units, referred to as monomers. Polymers can be natural (starch is a polymer of sugar residues\nand proteins are polymers of amino acids) or synthetic [like polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and\npolystyrene]. The variety of structures of polymers translates into a broad range of properties and uses that\nmake them integral parts of our everyday lives. Adding functional groups to the structure of a polymer can\nresult in significantly different properties (see the discussion about Kevlar later in this chapter).\nAn example of a polymerization reaction is shown in Figure 20.8. The monomer ethylene (C2H4) is a gas at\nroom temperature, but when polymerized, using a transition metal catalyst, it is transformed into a solid\nmaterial made up of long chains of –CH2– units called polyethylene. Polyethylene is a commodity plastic\nused primarily for packaging (bags and films).\nFIGURE 20.8\nThe reaction for the polymerization of ethylene to polyethylene is shown.\nPolyethylene is a member of one subset of synthetic polymers classified as plastics. Plastics are synthetic\norganic solids that can be molded; they are typically organic polymers with high molecular masses. Most of\nthe monomers that go into common plastics (ethylene, propylene, vinyl chloride, styrene, and ethylene\nterephthalate) are derived from petrochemicals and are not very biodegradable, making them candidate\nmaterials for recycling. Recycling plastics helps minimize the need for using more of the petrochemical\nsupplies and also minimizes the environmental damage caused by throwing away these nonbiodegradable\nmaterials.\nPlastic recycling is the process of recovering waste, scrap, or used plastics, and reprocessing the material\ninto useful products. For example, polyethylene terephthalate (soft drink bottles) can be melted down and\nused for plastic furniture, in carpets, or for other applications. Other plastics, like polyethylene (bags) and\npolypropylene (cups, plastic food containers), can be recycled or reprocessed to be used again. Many areas\nof the country have recycling programs that focus on one or more of the commodity plastics that have been\nassigned a recycling code (see Figure 20.9). These operations have been in effect since the 1970s and have\nmade the production of some plastics among the most efficient industrial operations today.\n20.1 • Hydrocarbons\n989",

The dietary forms of\ncarbohydrates are foods rich in these types of molecules, like pastas, bread, and candy. The name\n“carbohydrate” comes from the formula of the molecules, which can be described by the general formula\nCm(H2O)n, which shows that they are in a sense “carbon and water” or “hydrates of carbon.” In many cases,\nm and n have the same value, but they can be different. The smaller carbohydrates are generally referred to\nas “sugars,” the biochemical term for this group of molecules is “saccharide” from the Greek word for sugar\n(Figure 20.12). Depending on the number of sugar units joined together, they may be classified as\nmonosaccharides (one sugar unit), disaccharides (two sugar units), oligosaccharides (a few sugars), or\npolysaccharides (the polymeric version of sugars—polymers were described in the feature box earlier in\nthis chapter on recycling plastics). The scientific names of sugars can be recognized by the suffix -ose at\nthe end of the name (for instance, fruit sugar is a monosaccharide called “fructose” and milk sugar is a\ndisaccharide called lactose composed of two monosaccharides, glucose and galactose, connected together).\nSugars contain some of the functional groups we have discussed: Note the alcohol groups present in the\nstructures and how monosaccharide units are linked to form a disaccharide by formation of an ether.\nFIGURE 20.12\nThe illustrations show the molecular structures of fructose, a five-carbon monosaccharide, and\nof lactose, a disaccharide composed of two isomeric, six-carbon sugars.\nOrganisms use carbohydrates for a variety of functions. Carbohydrates can store energy, such as the\npolysaccharides glycogen in animals or starch in plants. They also provide structural support, such as the\npolysaccharide cellulose in plants and the modified polysaccharide chitin in fungi and animals. The sugars\nribose and deoxyribose are components of the backbones of RNA and DNA, respectively. Other sugars play\nkey roles in the function of the immune system, in cell-cell recognition, and in many other biological roles.\nDiabetes is a group of metabolic diseases in which a person has a high sugar concentration in their blood\n(Figure 20.13). Diabetes may be caused by insufficient insulin production by the pancreas or by the body’s\ncells not responding properly to the insulin that is produced. In a healthy person, insulin is produced when\nit is needed and functions to transport glucose from the blood into the cells where it can be used for energy.\n998\n20 • Organic Chemistry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Two of the sp2 orbitals on the carbon atom in the carbonyl group\nare used to form σ bonds to the other carbon or hydrogen atoms in a molecule. The remaining sp2 hybrid\norbital forms a σ bond to the oxygen atom. The unhybridized p orbital on the carbon atom in the carbonyl\ngroup overlaps a p orbital on the oxygen atom to form the π bond in the double bond.\nLike the\nbond in carbon dioxide, the\nbond of a carbonyl group is polar (recall that oxygen is\nsignificantly more electronegative than carbon, and the shared electrons are pulled toward the oxygen atom\nand away from the carbon atom). Many of the reactions of aldehydes and ketones start with the reaction\nbetween a Lewis base and the carbon atom at the positive end of the polar\nbond to yield an unstable\nintermediate that subsequently undergoes one or more structural rearrangements to form the final product\n(Figure 20.14).\nFIGURE 20.14\nThe carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal\nplanar.\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions\nthat produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol—for organic\nmolecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbon-\noxygen bond. The reverse reaction—replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond—is a\nreduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a –2 oxidation number unless it is\nelemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is\nattached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined\nalgebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a\ncarbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom\nattached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your\nunderstanding of the polarity of C–O and C–H bonds.

The nitrogen atom in an amine has a lone pair of\nelectrons and three bonds to other atoms, either carbon or hydrogen. Various nomenclatures are used to\nderive names for amines, but all involve the class-identifying suffix –ine as illustrated here for a few simple\nexamples:\nIn some amines, the nitrogen atom replaces a carbon atom in an aromatic hydrocarbon. Pyridine (Figure\n20.17) is one such heterocyclic amine. A heterocyclic compound contains atoms of two or more different\nelements in its ring structure.\nFIGURE 20.17\nThe illustration shows one of the resonance structures of pyridine.\nHOW SCIENCES INTERCONNECT\nDNA in Forensics and Paternity\nThe genetic material for all living things is a polymer of four different molecules, which are themselves a\ncombination of three subunits. The genetic information, the code for developing an organism, is contained in\nthe specific sequence of the four molecules, similar to the way the letters of the alphabet can be sequenced to\nform words that convey information. The information in a DNA sequence is used to form two other types of\npolymers, one of which are proteins. The proteins interact to form a specific type of organism with individual\ncharacteristics.\nA genetic molecule is called DNA, which stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. The four molecules that make up\nDNA are called nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a single- or double-ringed molecule containing\nnitrogen, carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen called a nitrogenous base. Each base is bonded to a five-carbon sugar\ncalled deoxyribose. The sugar is in turn bonded to a phosphate group\nWhen new DNA is made, a\npolymerization reaction occurs that binds the phosphate group of one nucleotide to the sugar group of a\nsecond nucleotide. The nitrogenous bases of each nucleotide stick out from this sugar-phosphate backbone.\nDNA is actually formed from two such polymers coiled around each other and held together by hydrogen\nbonds between the nitrogenous bases. Thus, the two backbones are on the outside of the coiled pair of strands,\nand the bases are on the inside. The shape of the two strands wound around each other is called a double helix\n(see Figure 20.18).\nIt probably makes sense that the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA of a cat differs from those of a dog. But it\nis also true that the sequences of the DNA in the cells of two individual pugs differ. Likewise, the sequences of\nDNA in you and a sibling differ (unless your sibling is an identical twin), as do those between you and an\nunrelated individual. However, the DNA sequences of two related individuals are more similar than the\nsequences of two unrelated individuals, and these similarities in sequence can be observed in various ways.\n20.4 • Amines and Amides\n1005",

They are also found in many molecules essential to\nlife, such as amino acids, hormones, neurotransmitters, and DNA.\nHOW SCIENCES INTERCONNECT\nAddictive Alkaloids\nSince ancient times, plants have been used for medicinal purposes. One class of substances, called alkaloids,\nfound in many of these plants has been isolated and found to contain cyclic molecules with an amine\nfunctional group. These amines are bases. They can react with H3O+ in a dilute acid to form an ammonium\nsalt, and this property is used to extract them from the plant:\nThe name alkaloid means “like an alkali.” Thus, an alkaloid reacts with acid. The free compound can be\nrecovered after extraction by reaction with a base:\nThe structures of many naturally occurring alkaloids have profound physiological and psychotropic effects in\nhumans.

It is through this\nreaction that amino acids (molecules containing both amine and carboxylic acid substituents) link together in\na polymer to form proteins.\nHOW SCIENCES INTERCONNECT\nProteins and Enzymes\nProteins are large biological molecules made up of long chains of smaller molecules called amino acids.\nOrganisms rely on proteins for a variety of functions—proteins transport molecules across cell membranes,\nreplicate DNA, and catalyze metabolic reactions, to name only a few of their functions. The properties of\nproteins are functions of the combination of amino acids that compose them and can vary greatly. Interactions\nbetween amino acid sequences in the chains of proteins result in the folding of the chain into specific, three-\ndimensional structures that determine the protein’s activity.\nAmino acids are organic molecules that contain an amine functional group (–NH2), a carboxylic acid\nfunctional group (–COOH), and a side chain (that is specific to each individual amino acid). Most living things\nbuild proteins from the same 20 different amino acids. Amino acids connect by the formation of a peptide\nbond, which is a covalent bond formed between two amino acids when the carboxylic acid group of one amino\nacid reacts with the amine group of the other amino acid. The formation of the bond results in the production\nof a molecule of water (in general, reactions that result in the production of water when two other molecules\ncombine are referred to as condensation reactions). The resulting bond—between the carbonyl group carbon\natom and the amine nitrogen atom is called a peptide link or peptide bond. Since each of the original amino\nacids has an unreacted group (one has an unreacted amine and the other an unreacted carboxylic acid), more\npeptide bonds can form to other amino acids, extending the structure. (Figure 20.20) A chain of connected\namino acids is called a polypeptide. Proteins contain at least one long polypeptide chain.\n20.4 • Amines and Amides\n1009",

Enzymes are highly specific catalysts; they speed up the\nrates of certain reactions. Enzymes function by lowering the activation energy of the reaction they are\ncatalyzing, which can dramatically increase the rate of the reaction. Most reactions catalyzed by enzymes have\nrates that are millions of times faster than the noncatalyzed version. Like all catalysts, enzymes are not\nconsumed during the reactions that they catalyze. Enzymes do differ from other catalysts in how specific they\nare for their substrates (the molecules that an enzyme will convert into a different product). Each enzyme is\nonly capable of speeding up one or a few very specific reactions or types of reactions. Since the function of\nenzymes is so specific, the lack or malfunctioning of an enzyme can lead to serious health consequences. One\ndisease that is the result of an enzyme malfunction is phenylketonuria. In this disease, the enzyme that\ncatalyzes the first step in the degradation of the amino acid phenylalanine is not functional (Figure 20.21).\nUntreated, this can lead to an accumulation of phenylalanine, which can lead to intellectual disabilities.\n1010\n20 • Organic Chemistry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

The material was developed by Susan\nKwolek while she worked to find a replacement for steel in tires. Kwolek's work involved synthesizing\npolyamides and dissolving them in solvents, then spinning the resulting solution into fibers. One of her\nsolutions proved to be quite different in initial appearance and structure. And once spun, the resulting\nfibers were particularly strong. From this initial discovery, Kevlar was created. The material has a high\ntensile strength-to-weight ratio (it is about 5 times stronger than an equal weight of steel), making it useful\nfor many applications from bicycle tires to sails to body armor.\nFIGURE 20.22\nThis illustration shows the formula for polymeric Kevlar.\nThe material owes much of its strength to hydrogen bonds between polymer chains (refer back to the\nchapter on intermolecular interactions). These bonds form between the carbonyl group oxygen atom\n(which has a partial negative charge due to oxygen’s electronegativity) on one monomer and the partially\npositively charged hydrogen atom in the N–H bond of an adjacent monomer in the polymer structure (see\ndashed line in Figure 20.23).

The chemistry of these compounds is\ncalled organic chemistry. Hydrocarbons are organic\ncompounds composed of only carbon and hydrogen.\nThe alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons—that is,\nhydrocarbons that contain only single bonds.\nAlkenes contain one or more carbon-carbon double\nbonds. Alkynes contain one or more carbon-carbon\ntriple bonds. Aromatic hydrocarbons contain ring\nstructures with delocalized π electron systems.\n20.2 Alcohols and Ethers\nMany organic compounds that are not hydrocarbons\ncan be thought of as derivatives of hydrocarbons. A\nhydrocarbon derivative can be formed by replacing\none or more hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon by a\nfunctional group, which contains at least one atom of\nan element other than carbon or hydrogen. The\nproperties of hydrocarbon derivatives are\ndetermined largely by the functional group. The –OH\ngroup is the functional group of an alcohol. The\n–R–O–R– group is the functional group of an ether.\n20.3 Aldehydes, Ketones, Carboxylic Acids,\nand Esters\nFunctional groups related to the carbonyl group\ninclude the –CHO group of an aldehyde, the –CO–\ngroup of a ketone, the –CO2H group of a carboxylic\nacid, and the –CO2R group of an ester. The carbonyl\ngroup, a carbon-oxygen double bond, is the key\nstructure in these classes of organic molecules:\nAldehydes contain at least one hydrogen atom\nattached to the carbonyl carbon atom, ketones\ncontain two carbon groups attached to the carbonyl\ncarbon atom, carboxylic acids contain a hydroxyl\n1014\n20 • Key Terms\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

The chapter on atoms,\nmolecules, and ions introduced the basic idea of nuclear structure, that the nucleus of an atom is composed of\nprotons and, with the exception of\nneutrons. Recall that the number of protons in the nucleus is called the\natomic number (Z) of the element, and the sum of the number of protons and the number of neutrons is the\nmass number (A). Atoms with the same atomic number but different mass numbers are isotopes of the same\nelement. When referring to a single type of nucleus, we often use the term nuclide and identify it by the\nnotation\nwhere X is the symbol for the element, A is the mass number, and Z is the atomic number (for\nexample,\nOften a nuclide is referenced by the name of the element followed by a hyphen and the mass\nnumber. For example,\nis called “carbon-14.”\nProtons and neutrons, collectively called nucleons, are packed together tightly in a nucleus. With a radius of\nabout 10−15 meters, a nucleus is quite small compared to the radius of the entire atom, which is about 10−10\nmeters. Nuclei are extremely dense compared to bulk matter, averaging 1.8\n1014 grams per cubic centimeter.\nFor example, water has a density of 1 gram per cubic centimeter, and iridium, one of the densest elements\nknown, has a density of 22.6 g/cm3. If the earth’s density were equal to the average nuclear density, the earth’s\nradius would be only about 200 meters (earth’s actual radius is approximately 6.4\n106 meters, 30,000 times\nlarger). Example 21.1 demonstrates just how great nuclear densities can be in the natural world.\nEXAMPLE 21.1\nDensity of a Neutron Star\nNeutron stars form when the core of a very massive star undergoes gravitational collapse, causing the star’s\nouter layers to explode in a supernova. Composed almost completely of neutrons, they are the densest-known\nstars in the universe, with densities comparable to the average density of an atomic nucleus. A neutron star in\na faraway galaxy has a mass equal to 2.4 solar masses (1 solar mass =\n= mass of the sun = 1.99\n1030 kg)\nand a diameter of 26 km.\n(a) What is the density of this neutron star?\n(b) How does this neutron star’s density compare to the density of a uranium nucleus, which has a diameter of\nabout 15 fm (1 fm = 10–15 m)?\nSolution\nWe can treat both the neutron star and the U-235 nucleus as spheres. Then the density for both is given by:\n(a) The radius of the neutron star is\nso the density of the\nneutron star is:\n(b) The radius of the U-235 nucleus is\nso the density of the U-235\nnucleus is:\n1022\n21 • Nuclear Chemistry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

The density of a hydrogen nucleus is 6.0\n1017 kg/m3. The\nneutron star is 5.7 times denser than the hydrogen nucleus.\nTo hold positively charged protons together in the very small volume of a nucleus requires very strong\nattractive forces because the positively charged protons repel one another strongly at such short distances.\nThe force of attraction that holds the nucleus together is the strong nuclear force. (The strong force is one of\nthe four fundamental forces that are known to exist. The others are the electromagnetic force, the gravitational\nforce, and the nuclear weak force.) This force acts between protons, between neutrons, and between protons\nand neutrons. It is very different from the electrostatic force that holds negatively charged electrons around a\npositively charged nucleus (the attraction between opposite charges). Over distances less than 10−15 meters\nand within the nucleus, the strong nuclear force is much stronger than electrostatic repulsions between\nprotons; over larger distances and outside the nucleus, it is essentially nonexistent.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit this website (http://openstax.org/l/16fourfund) for more information about the four fundamental forces.\nNuclear Binding Energy\nAs a simple example of the energy associated with the strong nuclear force, consider the helium atom\ncomposed of two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons. The total mass of these six subatomic particles may\nbe calculated as:\nHowever, mass spectrometric measurements reveal that the mass of an\natom is 4.0026 amu, less than the\ncombined masses of its six constituent subatomic particles. This difference between the calculated and\nexperimentally measured masses is known as the mass defect of the atom. In the case of helium, the mass\ndefect indicates a “loss” in mass of 4.0331 amu – 4.0026 amu = 0.0305 amu. The loss in mass accompanying\nthe formation of an atom from protons, neutrons, and electrons is due to the conversion of that mass into\nenergy that is evolved as the atom forms. The nuclear binding energy is the energy produced when the atoms’\nnucleons are bound together; this is also the energy needed to break a nucleus into its constituent protons and\nneutrons. In comparison to chemical bond energies, nuclear binding energies are vastly greater, as we will\nlearn in this section. Consequently, the energy changes associated with nuclear reactions are vastly greater\nthan are those for chemical reactions.\nThe conversion between mass and energy is most identifiably represented by the mass-energy equivalence\nequation as stated by Albert Einstein:\nwhere E is energy, m is mass of the matter being converted, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum. This\nequation can be used to find the amount of energy that results when matter is converted into energy. Using this\n21.1 • Nuclear Structure and Stability\n1023",

On the other hand, nuclear binding energies are typically on the order of billions of kJ/mol,\ncorresponding to mass differences in the milligram range (10–3 g).\nNuclear Stability\nA nucleus is stable if it cannot be transformed into another configuration without adding energy from the\noutside. Of the thousands of nuclides that exist, about 250 are stable. A plot of the number of neutrons versus\nthe number of protons for stable nuclei reveals that the stable isotopes fall into a narrow band. This region is\nknown as the band of stability (also called the belt, zone, or valley of stability). The straight line in Figure 21.2\nrepresents nuclei that have a 1:1 ratio of protons to neutrons (n:p ratio). Note that the lighter stable nuclei, in\ngeneral, have equal numbers of protons and neutrons. For example, nitrogen-14 has seven protons and seven\nneutrons. Heavier stable nuclei, however, have increasingly more neutrons than protons. For example: iron-56\nhas 30 neutrons and 26 protons, an n:p ratio of 1.15, whereas the stable nuclide lead-207 has 125 neutrons\nand 82 protons, an n:p ratio equal to 1.52. This is because larger nuclei have more proton-proton repulsions,\nand require larger numbers of neutrons to provide compensating strong forces to overcome these electrostatic\nrepulsions and hold the nucleus together.\n21.1 • Nuclear Structure and Stability\n1025",

During the beginning of the twentieth\ncentury, many radioactive substances were discovered, the properties of radiation were investigated and\nquantified, and a solid understanding of radiation and nuclear decay was developed.\nThe spontaneous change of an unstable nuclide into another is radioactive decay. The unstable nuclide is\ncalled the parent nuclide; the nuclide that results from the decay is known as the daughter nuclide. The\ndaughter nuclide may be stable, or it may decay itself. The radiation produced during radioactive decay is such\nthat the daughter nuclide lies closer to the band of stability than the parent nuclide, so the location of a nuclide\nrelative to the band of stability can serve as a guide to the kind of decay it will undergo (Figure 21.5).\nFIGURE 21.5\nA nucleus of uranium-238 (the parent nuclide) undergoes α decay to form thorium-234 (the\ndaughter nuclide).

We now know that α particles are high-energy helium nuclei, β\nparticles are high-energy electrons, and γ radiation compose high-energy electromagnetic radiation. We\nclassify different types of radioactive decay by the radiation produced.\nFIGURE 21.6\nAlpha particles, which are attracted to the negative plate and deflected by a relatively small amount,\nmust be positively charged and relatively massive. Beta particles, which are attracted to the positive plate and\ndeflected a relatively large amount, must be negatively charged and relatively light. Gamma rays, which are\nunaffected by the electric field, must be uncharged.\nAlpha (α) decay is the emission of an α particle from the nucleus. For example, polonium-210 undergoes α\ndecay:\nAlpha decay occurs primarily in heavy nuclei (A > 200, Z > 83). Because the loss of an α particle gives a\ndaughter nuclide with a mass number four units smaller and an atomic number two units smaller than those\nof the parent nuclide, the daughter nuclide has a larger n:p ratio than the parent nuclide. If the parent nuclide\nundergoing α decay lies below the band of stability (refer to Figure 21.2), the daughter nuclide will lie closer to\nthe band.\nBeta (β) decay is the emission of an electron from a nucleus. Iodine-131 is an example of a nuclide that\nundergoes β decay:\nBeta decay, which can be thought of as the conversion of a neutron into a proton and a β particle, is observed in\nnuclides with a large n:p ratio. The beta particle (electron) emitted is from the atomic nucleus and is not one of\nthe electrons surrounding the nucleus. Such nuclei lie above the band of stability. Emission of an electron does\nnot change the mass number of the nuclide but does increase the number of its protons and decrease the\nnumber of its neutrons. Consequently, the n:p ratio is decreased, and the daughter nuclide lies closer to the\nband of stability than did the parent nuclide.\nGamma emission (γ emission) is observed when a nuclide is formed in an excited state and then decays to its\nground state with the emission of a γ ray, a quantum of high-energy electromagnetic radiation. The presence\nof a nucleus in an excited state is often indicated by an asterisk (*). Cobalt-60 emits γ radiation and is used in\nmany applications including cancer treatment:\nThere is no change in mass number or atomic number during the emission of a γ ray unless the γ emission\naccompanies one of the other modes of decay.\n1032\n21 • Nuclear Chemistry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

As the outer\nelectron drops into the vacancy, it will emit energy. In most cases, the energy emitted will be in the form of an\nX-ray. Like positron emission, electron capture occurs for “proton-rich” nuclei that lie below the band of\nstability.

Three of these series include most of the naturally radioactive elements of the periodic table.\nThey are the uranium series, the actinide series, and the thorium series. The neptunium series is a fourth\nseries, which is no longer significant on the earth because of the short half-lives of the species involved. Each\nseries is characterized by a parent (first member) that has a long half-life and a series of daughter nuclides that\nultimately lead to a stable end-product—that is, a nuclide on the band of stability (Figure 21.9). In all three\nseries, the end-product is a stable isotope of lead. The neptunium series, previously thought to terminate with\nbismuth-209, terminates with thallium-205.\nChemistry in Everyday Life\nPET Scan\nPositron emission tomography (PET) scans use radiation to diagnose and track health conditions and\nmonitor medical treatments by revealing how parts of a patient’s body function (Figure 21.8). To perform a\nPET scan, a positron-emitting radioisotope is produced in a cyclotron and then attached to a substance that\nis used by the part of the body being investigated. This “tagged” compound, or radiotracer, is then put into\nthe patient (injected via IV or breathed in as a gas), and how it is used by the tissue reveals how that organ\nor other area of the body functions.\nFIGURE 21.8\nA PET scanner (a) uses radiation to provide an image of how part of a patient’s body functions.\nThe scans it produces can be used to image a healthy brain (b) or can be used for diagnosing medical conditions\nsuch as Alzheimer’s disease (c). (credit a: modification of work by Jens Maus)\nFor example, F-18 is produced by proton bombardment of 18O\nand incorporated\ninto a glucose analog called fludeoxyglucose (FDG). How FDG is used by the body provides critical\ndiagnostic information; for example, since cancers use glucose differently than normal tissues, FDG can\nreveal cancers. The 18F emits positrons that interact with nearby electrons, producing a burst of gamma\nradiation. This energy is detected by the scanner and converted into a detailed, three-dimensional, color\nimage that shows how that part of the patient’s body functions. Different levels of gamma radiation produce\ndifferent amounts of brightness and colors in the image, which can then be interpreted by a radiologist to\nreveal what is going on. PET scans can detect heart damage and heart disease, help diagnose Alzheimer’s\ndisease, indicate the part of a brain that is affected by epilepsy, reveal cancer, show what stage it is, and\nhow much it has spread, and whether treatments are effective. Unlike magnetic resonance imaging and X-\nrays, which only show how something looks, the big advantage of PET scans is that they show how\nsomething functions. PET scans are now usually performed in conjunction with a computed tomography\nscan.\n1034\n21 • Nuclear Chemistry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

We will explore\nsome of the most common types of radioactive dating and how the particular isotopes work for each type.\nRadioactive Dating Using Carbon-14\nThe radioactivity of carbon-14 provides a method for dating objects that were a part of a living organism. This\nmethod of radiometric dating, which is also called radiocarbon dating or carbon-14 dating, is accurate for\ndating carbon-containing substances that are up to about 30,000 years old, and can provide reasonably\naccurate dates up to a maximum of about 50,000 years old.\nNaturally occurring carbon consists of three isotopes:\nwhich constitutes about 99% of the carbon on\nearth;\nabout 1% of the total; and trace amounts of\nCarbon-14 forms in the upper atmosphere by the\nreaction of nitrogen atoms with neutrons from cosmic rays in space:\nAll isotopes of carbon react with oxygen to produce CO2 molecules.

The incorporation of\nand\ninto plants is a regular part of the\nphotosynthesis process, which means that the\nratio found in a living plant is the same as the\nratio in the atmosphere. But when the plant dies, it no longer traps carbon through photosynthesis.\nBecause\nis a stable isotope and does not undergo radioactive decay, its concentration in the plant does not\nchange. However, carbon-14 decays by β emission with a half-life of 5730 years:\nThus, the\nratio gradually decreases after the plant dies. The decrease in the ratio with time provides\na measure of the time that has elapsed since the death of the plant (or other organism that ate the plant).\nFigure 21.11 visually depicts this process.\n1038\n21 • Nuclear Chemistry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

The accuracy of a\nstraightforward application of this technique depends on the\nratio in a living plant being the same\nnow as it was in an earlier era, but this is not always valid. Due to the increasing accumulation of CO2\nmolecules (largely\nin the atmosphere caused by combustion of fossil fuels (in which essentially all of\nthe\nhas decayed), the ratio of\nin the atmosphere may be changing. This manmade increase in\nin the atmosphere causes the\nratio to decrease, and this in turn affects the ratio in currently\nliving organisms on the earth. Fortunately, however, we can use other data, such as tree dating via examination\nof annual growth rings, to calculate correction factors. With these correction factors, accurate dates can be\ndetermined. In general, radioactive dating only works for about 10 half-lives; therefore, the limit for carbon-14\ndating is about 57,000 years.\nRadioactive Dating Using Nuclides Other than Carbon-14\nRadioactive dating can also use other radioactive nuclides with longer half-lives to date older events. For\nexample, uranium-238 (which decays in a series of steps into lead-206) can be used for establishing the age of\nrocks (and the approximate age of the oldest rocks on earth). Since U-238 has a half-life of 4.5 billion years, it\ntakes that amount of time for half of the original U-238 to decay into Pb-206. In a sample of rock that does not\ncontain appreciable amounts of Pb-208, the most abundant isotope of lead, we can assume that lead was not\npresent when the rock was formed. Therefore, by measuring and analyzing the ratio of U-238:Pb-206, we can\ndetermine the age of the rock. This assumes that all of the lead-206 present came from the decay of\nuranium-238. If there is additional lead-206 present, which is indicated by the presence of other lead isotopes\nin the sample, it is necessary to make an adjustment. Potassium-argon dating uses a similar method.

A slew of new discoveries in the 1930s and 1940s, along with World War II,\ncombined to usher in the Nuclear Age in the mid-twentieth century. Scientists learned how to create new\nsubstances, and certain isotopes of certain elements were found to possess the capacity to produce\nunprecedented amounts of energy, with the potential to cause tremendous damage during war, as well as\nproduce enormous amounts of power for society’s needs during peace.\nSynthesis of Nuclides\nNuclear transmutation is the conversion of one nuclide into another. It can occur by the radioactive decay of a\nnucleus, or the reaction of a nucleus with another particle. The first manmade nucleus was produced in Ernest\nRutherford’s laboratory in 1919 by a transmutation reaction, the bombardment of one type of nuclei with\nother nuclei or with neutrons. Rutherford bombarded nitrogen atoms with high-speed α particles from a\nnatural radioactive isotope of radium and observed protons resulting from the reaction:\nThe\nand\nnuclei that are produced are stable, so no further (nuclear) changes occur.\nTo reach the kinetic energies necessary to produce transmutation reactions, devices called particle\naccelerators are used. These devices use magnetic and electric fields to increase the speeds of nuclear\nparticles. In all accelerators, the particles move in a vacuum to avoid collisions with gas molecules. When\nneutrons are required for transmutation reactions, they are usually obtained from radioactive decay reactions\nor from various nuclear reactions occurring in nuclear reactors. The Chemistry in Everyday Life feature that\nfollows discusses a famous particle accelerator that made worldwide news.\nChemistry in Everyday Life\nCERN Particle Accelerator\nLocated near Geneva, the CERN (“Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire,” or European Council for\nNuclear Research) Laboratory is the world’s premier center for the investigations of the fundamental\nparticles that make up matter. It contains the 27-kilometer (17 mile) long, circular Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC), the largest particle accelerator in the world (Figure 21.13). In the LHC, particles are boosted to high\nenergies and are then made to collide with each other or with stationary targets at nearly the speed of light.\nSuperconducting electromagnets are used to produce a strong magnetic field that guides the particles\naround the ring.

On the other hand, if too many neutrons escape the bulk material without interacting with a\nnucleus, then no chain reaction will occur.\nFIGURE 21.16\nThe fission of a large nucleus, such as U-235, produces two or three neutrons, each of which is\ncapable of causing fission of another nucleus by the reactions shown.

(Technically, fissile\nmaterial can undergo fission with neutrons of any energy, whereas fissionable material requires high-energy\nneutrons.) Nuclear fission becomes self-sustaining when the number of neutrons produced by fission equals\nor exceeds the number of neutrons absorbed by splitting nuclei plus the number that escape into the\nsurroundings. The amount of a fissionable material that will support a self-sustaining chain reaction is a\ncritical mass. An amount of fissionable material that cannot sustain a chain reaction is a subcritical mass. An\namount of material in which there is an increasing rate of fission is known as a supercritical mass. The\ncritical mass depends on the type of material: its purity, the temperature, the shape of the sample, and how the\nneutron reactions are controlled (Figure 21.17).\nFIGURE 21.17\n(a) In a subcritical mass, the fissile material is too small and allows too many neutrons to escape\nthe material, so a chain reaction does not occur. (b) In a critical mass, a large enough number of neutrons in the\nfissile material induce fission to create a chain reaction.\nAn atomic bomb (Figure 21.18) contains several pounds of fissionable material,\nor\na source of\nneutrons, and an explosive device for compressing it quickly into a small volume. When fissionable material is\nin small pieces, the proportion of neutrons that escape through the relatively large surface area is great, and a\nchain reaction does not take place. When the small pieces of fissionable material are brought together quickly\nto form a body with a mass larger than the critical mass, the relative number of escaping neutrons decreases,\nand a chain reaction and explosion result.\n21.4 • Transmutation and Nuclear Energy\n1047",

Any nuclear reactor that produces power via the fission of uranium or plutonium by\nbombardment with neutrons must have at least five components: nuclear fuel consisting of fissionable\nmaterial, a nuclear moderator, reactor coolant, control rods, and a shield and containment system. We will\ndiscuss these components in greater detail later in the section. The reactor works by separating the fissionable\nnuclear material such that a critical mass cannot be formed, controlling both the flux and absorption of\nneutrons to allow shutting down the fission reactions. In a nuclear reactor used for the production of\nelectricity, the energy released by fission reactions is trapped as thermal energy and used to boil water and\nproduce steam. The steam is used to turn a turbine, which powers a generator for the production of electricity.\n1048\n21 • Nuclear Chemistry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

(credit a:\nmodification of work by “Mike” Michael L. Baird; credit b: modification of work by the Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission)\nNuclear Fuels\nNuclear fuel consists of a fissionable isotope, such as uranium-235, which must be present in sufficient\nquantity to provide a self-sustaining chain reaction. In the United States, uranium ores contain from\n0.05–0.3% of the uranium oxide U3O8; the uranium in the ore is about 99.3% nonfissionable U-238 with only\n0.7% fissionable U-235. Nuclear reactors require a fuel with a higher concentration of U-235 than is found in\nnature; it is normally enriched to have about 5% of uranium mass as U-235. At this concentration, it is not\npossible to achieve the supercritical mass necessary for a nuclear explosion. Uranium can be enriched by\ngaseous diffusion (the only method currently used in the US), using a gas centrifuge, or by laser separation.\nIn the gaseous diffusion enrichment plant where U-235 fuel is prepared, UF6 (uranium hexafluoride) gas at low\npressure moves through barriers that have holes just barely large enough for UF6 to pass through. The slightly\nlighter 235UF6 molecules diffuse through the barrier slightly faster than the heavier 238UF6 molecules. This\nprocess is repeated through hundreds of barriers, gradually increasing the concentration of 235UF6 to the level\nneeded by the nuclear reactor. The basis for this process, Graham’s law, is described in the chapter on gases.\nThe enriched UF6 gas is collected, cooled until it solidifies, and then taken to a fabrication facility where it is\nmade into fuel assemblies. Each fuel assembly consists of fuel rods that contain many thimble-sized, ceramic-\nencased, enriched uranium (usually UO2) fuel pellets. Modern nuclear reactors may contain as many as 10\nmillion fuel pellets. The amount of energy in each of these pellets is equal to that in almost a ton of coal or 150\ngallons of oil.\nNuclear Moderators\nNeutrons produced by nuclear reactions move too fast to cause fission (refer back to Figure 21.17). They must\nfirst be slowed to be absorbed by the fuel and produce additional nuclear reactions. A nuclear moderator is a\nsubstance that slows the neutrons to a speed that is low enough to cause fission. Early reactors used high-\npurity graphite as a moderator. Modern reactors in the US exclusively use heavy water\nor light water\n(ordinary H2O), whereas some reactors in other countries use other materials, such as carbon dioxide,\nberyllium, or graphite.\n21.4 • Transmutation and Nuclear Energy\n1049",

Two overlapping coolant loops are often used; this counteracts\nthe transfer of radioactivity from the reactor to the primary coolant loop. All nuclear power plants in the US\nuse water as a coolant. Other coolants include molten sodium, lead, a lead-bismuth mixture, or molten salts.\nControl Rods\nNuclear reactors use control rods (Figure 21.20) to control the fission rate of the nuclear fuel by adjusting the\nnumber of slow neutrons present to keep the rate of the chain reaction at a safe level. Control rods are made of\nboron, cadmium, hafnium, or other elements that are able to absorb neutrons. Boron-10, for example, absorbs\nneutrons by a reaction that produces lithium-7 and alpha particles:\nWhen control rod assemblies are inserted into the fuel element in the reactor core, they absorb a larger\nfraction of the slow neutrons, thereby slowing the rate of the fission reaction and decreasing the power\nproduced. Conversely, if the control rods are removed, fewer neutrons are absorbed, and the fission rate and\nenergy production increase. In an emergency, the chain reaction can be shut down by fully inserting all of the\ncontrol rods into the nuclear core between the fuel rods.\nFIGURE 21.20\nThe nuclear reactor core shown in (a) contains the fuel and control rod assembly shown in (b).\n1050\n21 • Nuclear Chemistry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Even when shut down, the\ndecay products are radioactive. In addition, an operating reactor is thermally very hot, and high pressures\nresult from the circulation of water or another coolant through it. Thus, a reactor must withstand high\ntemperatures and pressures, and must protect operating personnel from the radiation. Reactors are equipped\nwith a containment system (or shield) that consists of three parts:\n1.\nThe reactor vessel, a steel shell that is 3–20-centimeters thick and, with the moderator, absorbs much of\nthe radiation produced by the reactor\n2.\nA main shield of 1–3 meters of high-density concrete\n3.\nA personnel shield of lighter materials that protects operators from γ rays and X-rays\nIn addition, reactors are often covered with a steel or concrete dome that is designed to contain any radioactive\nmaterials might be released by a reactor accident.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nClick here to watch a 3-minute video (http://openstax.org/l/16nucreactors) from the Nuclear Energy Institute\non how nuclear reactors work.\nNuclear power plants are designed in such a way that they cannot form a supercritical mass of fissionable\nmaterial and therefore cannot create a nuclear explosion. But as history has shown, failures of systems and\nsafeguards can cause catastrophic accidents, including chemical explosions and nuclear meltdowns (damage\nto the reactor core from overheating). The following Chemistry in Everyday Life feature explores three\ninfamous meltdown incidents.\nChemistry in Everyday Life\nNuclear Accidents\nThe importance of cooling and containment are amply illustrated by three major accidents that occurred\nwith the nuclear reactors at nuclear power generating stations in the United States (Three Mile Island), the\nformer Soviet Union (Chernobyl), and Japan (Fukushima).\nIn March 1979, the cooling system of the Unit 2 reactor at Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in\nPennsylvania failed, and the cooling water spilled from the reactor onto the floor of the containment\nbuilding. After the pumps stopped, the reactors overheated due to the high radioactive decay heat\nproduced in the first few days after the nuclear reactor shut down. The temperature of the core climbed to\nat least 2200 °C, and the upper portion of the core began to melt. In addition, the zirconium alloy cladding\nof the fuel rods began to react with steam and produced hydrogen:\nThe hydrogen accumulated in the confinement building, and it was feared that there was danger of an\nexplosion of the mixture of hydrogen and air in the building. Consequently, hydrogen gas and radioactive\ngases (primarily krypton and xenon) were vented from the building. Within a week, cooling water\ncirculation was restored and the core began to cool. The plant was closed for nearly 10 years during the\ncleanup process.\nAlthough zero discharge of radioactive material is desirable, the discharge of radioactive krypton and\nxenon, such as occurred at the Three Mile Island plant, is among the most tolerable. These gases readily\ndisperse in the atmosphere and thus do not produce highly radioactive areas. Moreover, they are noble\ngases and are not incorporated into plant and animal matter in the food chain. Effectively none of the\nheavy elements of the core of the reactor were released into the environment, and no cleanup of the area\noutside of the containment building was necessary (Figure 21.21).\n21.4 • Transmutation and Nuclear Energy\n1051",

(b) President Jimmy Carter visited the Unit 2 control room a few days after\nthe accident in 1979.\nAnother major nuclear accident involving a reactor occurred in April 1986, at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power\nPlant in Ukraine, which was still a part of the former Soviet Union. While operating at low power during an\nunauthorized experiment with some of its safety devices shut off, one of the reactors at the plant became\nunstable. Its chain reaction became uncontrollable and increased to a level far beyond what the reactor was\ndesigned for. The steam pressure in the reactor rose to between 100 and 500 times the full power pressure\nand ruptured the reactor. Because the reactor was not enclosed in a containment building, a large amount\nof radioactive material spewed out, and additional fission products were released, as the graphite (carbon)\nmoderator of the core ignited and burned. The fire was controlled, but over 200 plant workers and\nfirefighters developed acute radiation sickness and at least 32 soon died from the effects of the radiation. It\nis predicted that about 4000 more deaths will occur among emergency workers and former Chernobyl\nresidents from radiation-induced cancer and leukemia. The reactor has since been encapsulated in steel\nand concrete, a now-decaying structure known as the sarcophagus. Almost 30 years later, significant\nradiation problems still persist in the area, and Chernobyl largely remains a wasteland.\nIn 2011, the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan was badly damaged by a 9.0-magnitude\nearthquake and resulting tsunami. Three reactors up and running at the time were shut down\nautomatically, and emergency generators came online to power electronics and coolant systems. However,\nthe tsunami quickly flooded the emergency generators and cut power to the pumps that circulated coolant\nwater through the reactors. High-temperature steam in the reactors reacted with zirconium alloy to\nproduce hydrogen gas. The gas escaped into the containment building, and the mixture of hydrogen and\nair exploded. Radioactive material was released from the containment vessels as the result of deliberate\nventing to reduce the hydrogen pressure, deliberate discharge of coolant water into the sea, and accidental\nor uncontrolled events.\nAn evacuation zone around the damaged plant extended over 12.4 miles away, and an estimated 200,000\npeople were evacuated from the area. All 48 of Japan’s nuclear power plants were subsequently shut down,\nremaining shuttered as of December 2014. Since the disaster, public opinion has shifted from largely\nfavoring to largely opposing increasing the use of nuclear power plants, and a restart of Japan’s atomic\nenergy program is still stalled (Figure 21.22).\n1052\n21 • Nuclear Chemistry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

As discussed previously, the plutonium forms\nfrom the combination of neutrons and the uranium in the fuel. In any nuclear reactor, only about 0.1% of the\nmass of the fuel is converted into energy. The other 99.9% remains in the fuel rods as fission products and\nunused fuel.

The very high temperature is necessary to give the nuclei enough kinetic energy to\novercome the very strong repulsive forces resulting from the positive charges on their nuclei so they can\ncollide.\nUseful fusion reactions require very high temperatures for their initiation—about 15,000,000 K or more. At\nthese temperatures, all molecules dissociate into atoms, and the atoms ionize, forming plasma. These\nconditions occur in an extremely large number of locations throughout the universe—stars are powered by\nfusion. Humans have already figured out how to create temperatures high enough to achieve fusion on a large\nscale in thermonuclear weapons. A thermonuclear weapon such as a hydrogen bomb contains a nuclear\nfission bomb that, when exploded, gives off enough energy to produce the extremely high temperatures\nnecessary for fusion to occur.\nAnother much more beneficial way to create fusion reactions is in a fusion reactor, a nuclear reactor in which\nfusion reactions of light nuclei are controlled. Because no solid materials are stable at such high temperatures,\nmechanical devices cannot contain the plasma in which fusion reactions occur. Two techniques to contain\nplasma at the density and temperature necessary for a fusion reaction are currently the focus of intensive\nresearch efforts: containment by a magnetic field and by the use of focused laser beams (Figure 21.23). A\nnumber of large projects are working to attain one of the biggest goals in science: getting hydrogen fuel to\nignite and produce more energy than the amount supplied to achieve the extremely high temperatures and\npressures that are required for fusion.

If we replace one (or more) atom(s) with radioisotope(s) in a compound, we\ncan track them by monitoring their radioactive emissions. This type of compound is called a radioactive\ntracer (or radioactive label). Radioisotopes are used to follow the paths of biochemical reactions or to\ndetermine how a substance is distributed within an organism. Radioactive tracers are also used in many\nmedical applications, including both diagnosis and treatment. They are used to measure engine wear, analyze\nthe geological formation around oil wells, and much more.\nRadioimmunossays (RIA), for example, rely on radioisotopes to detect the presence and/or concentration of\ncertain antigens. Developed by Rosalyn Sussman Yalow and Solomon Berson in the 1950s, the technique is\nknown for extreme sensitivity, meaning that it can detect and measure very small quantities of a substance.\nPrior to its discovery, most similar detection relied on large enough quantities to produce visible outcomes.\nRIA revolutionized and expanded entire fields of study, most notably endocrinology, and is commonly used in\nnarcotics detection, blood bank screening, early cancer screening, hormone measurement, and allergy\ndiagnosis. Based on her significant contribution to medicine, Yalow received a Nobel Prize, making her the\nsecond woman to be awarded the prize for medicine.\nRadioisotopes have revolutionized medical practice (see Appendix M), where they are used extensively. Over\n10 million nuclear medicine procedures and more than 100 million nuclear medicine tests are performed\nannually in the United States. Four typical examples of radioactive tracers used in medicine are technetium-99\n, thallium-201\n, iodine-131\n, and sodium-24\n. Damaged tissues in the heart, liver,\nand lungs absorb certain compounds of technetium-99 preferentially. After it is injected, the location of the\ntechnetium compound, and hence the damaged tissue, can be determined by detecting the γ rays emitted by\nthe Tc-99 isotope. Thallium-201 (Figure 21.24) becomes concentrated in healthy heart tissue, so the two\nisotopes, Tc-99 and Tl-201, are used together to study heart tissue. Iodine-131 concentrates in the thyroid\ngland, the liver, and some parts of the brain. It can therefore be used to monitor goiter and treat thyroid\nconditions, such as Grave’s disease, as well as liver and brain tumors. Salt solutions containing compounds of\nsodium-24 are injected into the bloodstream to help locate obstructions to the flow of blood.\n21.5 • Uses of Radioisotopes\n1055",

All radioactive nuclides emit high-energy particles or electromagnetic\nwaves. When this radiation encounters living cells, it can cause heating, break chemical bonds, or ionize\nmolecules. The most serious biological damage results when these radioactive emissions fragment or ionize\nmolecules. For example, alpha and beta particles emitted from nuclear decay reactions possess much higher\nenergies than ordinary chemical bond energies. When these particles strike and penetrate matter, they\nproduce ions and molecular fragments that are extremely reactive. The damage this does to biomolecules in\nliving organisms can cause serious malfunctions in normal cell processes, taxing the organism’s repair\nmechanisms and possibly causing illness or even death (Figure 21.30).\nFIGURE 21.30\nRadiation can harm biological systems by damaging the DNA of cells.

Although biological systems are sensitive to heat (as we might know from\ntouching a hot stove or spending a day at the beach in the sun), a large amount of nonionizing radiation is\nnecessary before dangerous levels are reached. Ionizing radiation, however, may cause much more severe\ndamage by breaking bonds or removing electrons in biological molecules, disrupting their structure and\nfunction. The damage can also be done indirectly, by first ionizing H2O (the most abundant molecule in living\norganisms), which forms a H2O+ ion that reacts with water, forming a hydronium ion and a hydroxyl radical:\nBecause the hydroxyl radical has an unpaired electron, it is highly reactive. (This is true of any substance with\nunpaired electrons, known as a free radical.) This hydroxyl radical can react with all kinds of biological\nmolecules (DNA, proteins, enzymes, and so on), causing damage to the molecules and disrupting physiological\nprocesses.

          "text": "causing damage indirectly.\nBiological Effects of Exposure to Radiation\nRadiation can harm either the whole body (somatic damage) or eggs and sperm (genetic damage). Its effects\nare more pronounced in cells that reproduce rapidly, such as the stomach lining, hair follicles, bone marrow,\nand embryos. This is why patients undergoing radiation therapy often feel nauseous or sick to their stomach,\nlose hair, have bone aches, and so on, and why particular care must be taken when undergoing radiation\ntherapy during pregnancy.\nDifferent types of radiation have differing abilities to pass through material (Figure 21.33). A very thin barrier,\nsuch as a sheet or two of paper, or the top layer of skin cells, usually stops alpha particles. Because of this,\nalpha particle sources are usually not dangerous if outside the body, but are quite hazardous if ingested or\ninhaled (see the Chemistry in Everyday Life feature on Radon Exposure). Beta particles will pass through a\nhand, or a thin layer of material like paper or wood, but are stopped by a thin layer of metal. Gamma radiation\nis very penetrating and can pass through a thick layer of most materials. Some high-energy gamma radiation\nis able to pass through a few feet of concrete. Certain dense, high atomic number elements (such as lead) can\neffectively attenuate gamma radiation with thinner material and are used for shielding. The ability of various\nkinds of emissions to cause ionization varies greatly, and some particles have almost no tendency to produce\nionization. Alpha particles have about twice the ionizing power of fast-moving neutrons, about 10 times that of\nβ particles, and about 20 times that of γ rays and X-rays.\nFIGURE 21.33\nThe ability of different types of radiation to pass through material is shown. From least to most\npenetrating, they are alpha < beta < neutron < gamma.\nChemistry in Everyday Life\nRadon Exposure\nFor many people, one of the largest sources of exposure to radiation is from radon gas (Rn-222). Radon-222\nis an α emitter with a half–life of 3.82 days. It is one of the products of the radioactive decay series of U-238\n(Figure 21.9), which is found in trace amounts in soil and rocks. The radon gas that is produced slowly\nescapes from the ground and gradually seeps into homes and other structures above. Since it is about eight\ntimes more dense than air, radon gas accumulates in basements and lower floors, and slowly diffuses\nthroughout buildings (Figure 21.34).\n21.6 • Biological Effects of Radiation\n1061",

Probably the best-known radiation\ninstrument, the Geiger counter (also called the Geiger-Müller counter) detects and measures radiation.\nRadiation causes the ionization of the gas in a Geiger-Müller tube. The rate of ionization is proportional to the\namount of radiation. A scintillation counter contains a scintillator—a material that emits light (luminesces)\nwhen excited by ionizing radiation—and a sensor that converts the light into an electric signal. Radiation\ndosimeters also measure ionizing radiation and are often used to determine personal radiation exposure.\nCommonly used types are electronic, film badge, thermoluminescent, and quartz fiber dosimeters.\nFIGURE 21.34\nRadon-222 seeps into houses and other buildings from rocks that contain uranium-238, a\nradon emitter. The radon enters through cracks in concrete foundations and basement floors, stone or porous\ncinderblock foundations, and openings for water and gas pipes.\nRadon is found in buildings across the country, with amounts depending on where you live. The average\nconcentration of radon inside houses in the US (1.25 pCi/L) is about three times the levels found in outside\nair, and about one in six houses have radon levels high enough that remediation efforts to reduce the radon\nconcentration are recommended. Exposure to radon increases one’s risk of getting cancer (especially lung\ncancer), and high radon levels can be as bad for health as smoking a carton of cigarettes a day. Radon is the\nnumber one cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers and the second leading cause of lung cancer overall.\nRadon exposure is believed to cause over 20,000 deaths in the US per year.\n1062\n21 • Nuclear Chemistry\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

(credit c: modification of work by “osaMu”/Wikimedia commons)\nA variety of units are used to measure various aspects of radiation (Figure 21.36). The SI unit for rate of\nradioactive decay is the becquerel (Bq), with 1 Bq = 1 disintegration per second. The curie (Ci) and millicurie\n(mCi) are much larger units and are frequently used in medicine (1 curie = 1 Ci = 3.7\n1010 disintegrations\nper second). The SI unit for measuring radiation dose is the gray (Gy), with 1 Gy = 1 J of energy absorbed per\nkilogram of tissue. In medical applications, the radiation absorbed dose (rad) is more often used (1 rad = 0.01\nGy; 1 rad results in the absorption of 0.01 J/kg of tissue). The SI unit measuring tissue damage caused by\nradiation is the sievert (Sv). This takes into account both the energy and the biological effects of the type of\nradiation involved in the radiation dose. The roentgen equivalent for man (rem) is the unit for radiation\ndamage that is used most frequently in medicine (100 rem = 1 Sv). Note that the tissue damage units (rem or\nSv) includes the energy of the radiation dose (rad or Gy) along with a biological factor referred to as the RBE\n(for relative biological effectiveness) that is an approximate measure of the relative damage done by the\nradiation. These are related by:\nwith RBE approximately 10 for α radiation, 2(+) for protons and neutrons, and 1 for β and γ radiation.\nFIGURE 21.36\nDifferent units are used to measure the rate of emission from a radioactive source, the energy that\nis absorbed from the source, and the amount of damage the absorbed radiation does.\nUnits of Radiation Measurement\nTable 21.4 summarizes the units used for measuring radiation.\n21.6 • Biological Effects of Radiation\n1063",

          "text": "decay rate = λN\nrem = RBE\nrad\nSv = RBE\nGy\nSummary\n21.1 Nuclear Structure and Stability\nAn atomic nucleus consists of protons and neutrons,\ncollectively called nucleons. Although protons repel\neach other, the nucleus is held tightly together by a\nshort-range, but very strong, force called the strong\nnuclear force. A nucleus has less mass than the total\nmass of its constituent nucleons. This “missing”\nmass is the mass defect, which has been converted\ninto the binding energy that holds the nucleus\ntogether according to Einstein’s mass-energy\nequivalence equation, E = mc2. Of the many nuclides\nthat exist, only a small number are stable. Nuclides\nwith even numbers of protons or neutrons, or those\nwith magic numbers of nucleons, are especially\nlikely to be stable. These stable nuclides occupy a\nnarrow band of stability on a graph of number of\nprotons versus number of neutrons. The binding\nenergy per nucleon is largest for the elements with\nmass numbers near 56; these are the most stable\nnuclei.\n21.2 Nuclear Equations\nNuclei can undergo reactions that change their\nnumber of protons, number of neutrons, or energy\nstate. Many different particles can be involved in\nnuclear reactions. The most common are protons,\nneutrons, positrons (which are positively charged\nelectrons), alpha (α) particles (which are high-\nenergy helium nuclei), beta (β) particles (which are\nhigh-energy electrons), and gamma (γ) rays (which\ncompose high-energy electromagnetic radiation). As\nwith chemical reactions, nuclear reactions are\nalways balanced. When a nuclear reaction occurs,\nthe total mass (number) and the total charge remain\nunchanged.\n21.3 Radioactive Decay\nNuclei that have unstable n:p ratios undergo\nspontaneous radioactive decay. The most common\ntypes of radioactivity are α decay, β decay, γ\nemission, positron emission, and electron capture.\nNuclear reactions also often involve γ rays, and\nsome nuclei decay by electron capture. Each of these\nmodes of decay leads to the formation of a new\nnucleus with a more stable n:p ratio. Some\nsubstances undergo radioactive decay series,\nproceeding through multiple decays before ending\nin a stable isotope. All nuclear decay processes\nfollow first-order kinetics, and each radioisotope has\nits own characteristic half-life, the time that is\nrequired for half of its atoms to decay. Because of the\nlarge differences in stability among nuclides, there\nis a very wide range of half-lives of radioactive\nsubstances. Many of these substances have found\nuseful applications in medical diagnosis and\ntreatment, determining the age of archaeological\nand geological objects, and more.\n21.4 Transmutation and Nuclear Energy\nIt is possible to produce new atoms by bombarding\nother atoms with nuclei or high-speed particles. The\nproducts of these transmutation reactions can be\nstable or radioactive. A number of artificial\nelements, including technetium, astatine, and the\ntransuranium elements, have been produced in this\nway.\nNuclear power as well as nuclear weapon\ndetonations can be generated through fission\n(reactions in which a heavy nucleus is split into two\nor more lighter nuclei and several neutrons).\nBecause the neutrons may induce additional fission\nreactions when they combine with other heavy\nnuclei, a chain reaction can result. Useful power is\nobtained if the fission process is carried out in a\nnuclear reactor. The conversion of light nuclei into\nheavier nuclei (fusion) also produces energy. At\npresent, this energy has not been contained\nadequately and is too expensive to be feasible for\ncommercial energy production.\n21.5 Uses of Radioisotopes\nCompounds known as radioactive tracers can be\nused to follow reactions, track the distribution of a\nsubstance, diagnose and treat medical conditions,\nand much more. Other radioactive substances are\nhelpful for controlling pests, visualizing structures,\nproviding fire warnings, and for many other\napplications.

The radiation used for this\ntreatment may be delivered externally or internally.\n21.6 Biological Effects of Radiation\nWe are constantly exposed to radiation from a\nvariety of naturally occurring and human-produced\nsources. This radiation can affect living organisms.\nIonizing radiation is the most harmful because it can\nionize molecules or break chemical bonds, which\ndamages the molecule and causes malfunctions in\ncell processes. It can also create reactive hydroxyl\nradicals that damage biological molecules and\ndisrupt physiological processes. Radiation can cause\nsomatic or genetic damage, and is most harmful to\nrapidly reproducing cells. Types of radiation differ\nin their ability to penetrate material and damage\ntissue, with alpha particles the least penetrating but\npotentially most damaging and gamma rays the\nmost penetrating.\nVarious devices, including Geiger counters,\nscintillators, and dosimeters, are used to detect and\nmeasure radiation, and monitor radiation exposure.\nWe use several units to measure radiation:\nbecquerels or curies for rates of radioactive decay;\ngray or rads for energy absorbed; and rems or\nsieverts for biological effects of radiation. Exposure\nto radiation can cause a wide range of health effects,\nfrom minor to severe, and including death. We can\nminimize the effects of radiation by shielding with\ndense materials such as lead, moving away from the\nsource, and limiting time of exposure.\nExercises\n21.1 Nuclear Structure and Stability\n1.

The products consist of two\ngreen spheres and two purple spheres. This violates Dalton’s postulate that that atoms are not created\nduring a chemical change, but are merely redistributed.\n3. This statement violates Dalton’s fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type\n(and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n5. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass.\nThus, the concept of isotopes, in which an element has different masses, was a violation of the original\nidea. To account for the existence of isotopes, the second postulate of his atomic theory was modified to\nstate that atoms of the same element must have identical chemical properties.\n7. Both are subatomic particles that reside in an atom’s nucleus. Both have approximately the same mass.\nProtons are positively charged, whereas neutrons are uncharged.\n9. (a) The Rutherford atom has a small, positively charged nucleus, so most α particles will pass through\nempty space far from the nucleus and be undeflected. Those α particles that pass near the nucleus will be\ndeflected from their paths due to positive-positive repulsion. The more directly toward the nucleus the α\nparticles are headed, the larger the deflection angle will be. (b) Higher-energy α particles that pass near\nthe nucleus will still undergo deflection, but the faster they travel, the less the expected angle of deflection.\n(c) If the nucleus is smaller, the positive charge is smaller and the expected deflections are smaller—both\nin terms of how closely the α particles pass by the nucleus undeflected and the angle of deflection. If the\nnucleus is larger, the positive charge is larger and the expected deflections are larger—more α particles\nwill be deflected, and the deflection angles will be larger. (d) The paths followed by the α particles match\nthe predictions from (a), (b), and (c).\n11. (a) 133Cs+; (b) 127I−; (c) 31P3−; (d) 57Co3+\n1142\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

(a) Dispersion forces occur as an atom develops a temporary dipole moment when its electrons are\ndistributed asymmetrically about the nucleus. This structure is more prevalent in large atoms such as\nargon or radon. A second atom can then be distorted by the appearance of the dipole in the first atom. The\nelectrons of the second atom are attracted toward the positive end of the first atom, which sets up a dipole\nin the second atom. The net result is rapidly fluctuating, temporary dipoles that attract one another (e.g.,\nAr). (b) A dipole-dipole attraction is a force that results from an electrostatic attraction of the positive end\nof one polar molecule for the negative end of another polar molecule (e.g., ICI molecules attract one\nanother by dipole-dipole interaction). (c) Hydrogen bonds form whenever a hydrogen atom is bonded to\none of the more electronegative atoms, such as a fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen atom. The electrostatic\nattraction between the partially positive hydrogen atom in one molecule and the partially negative atom in\nanother molecule gives rise to a strong dipole-dipole interaction called a hydrogen bond (e.g.,\n9.

Only rather small dipole-dipole interactions from C-H bonds are available to hold n-butane in the liquid\nstate. Chloroethane, however, has rather large dipole interactions because of the Cl-C bond; the\ninteraction, therefore, is stronger, leading to a higher boiling point.\n15. −85 °C. Water has stronger hydrogen bonds, so it melts at a higher temperature.\n17. The hydrogen bond between two hydrogen fluoride molecules is stronger than that between two water\nmolecules because the electronegativity of F is greater than that of O. Consequently, the partial negative\ncharge on F is greater than that on O. The hydrogen bond between the partially positive H and the larger\npartially negative F will be stronger than that formed between H and O.\n19.

The water molecules have strong intermolecular forces of hydrogen bonding. The water molecules are\nthus attracted strongly to one another and exhibit a relatively large surface tension, forming a type of\n“skin” at its surface. This skin can support a bug or paper clip if gently placed on the water.\n25. Temperature has an effect on intermolecular forces: The higher the temperature, the greater the kinetic\nenergies of the molecules and the greater the extent to which their intermolecular forces are overcome,\nand so the more fluid (less viscous) the liquid. The lower the temperature, the less the intermolecular\nforces are overcome, and so the less viscous the liquid.\n27. (a) As the water reaches higher temperatures, the increased kinetic energies of its molecules are more\neffective in overcoming hydrogen bonding, and so its surface tension decreases. Surface tension and\nintermolecular forces are directly related. (b) The same trend in viscosity is seen as in surface tension,\nand for the same reason.\n29. 1.7\n10−4 m\n31.

The vapor pressure of a liquid decreases as the strength of its intermolecular forces increases.\n37.

The boiling point of CS2 is higher than that of CO2 partially because of the higher molecular weight of CS2;\nconsequently, the attractive forces are stronger in CS2. It would be expected, therefore, that the heat of\nvaporization would be greater than that of 9.8 kJ/mol for CO2. A value of 28 kJ/mol would seem\nreasonable.

Because a fuel cell\nis constantly resupplied with reactants and products are expelled, it can continue to function as long as\nreagents are supplied.\n36. Ecell, as described in the Nernst equation, has a term that is directly proportional to temperature.

Both examples involve cathodic protection. The (sacrificial) anode is the metal that corrodes (oxidizes or\nreacts). In the case of iron (−0.447 V) and zinc (−0.7618 V), zinc has a more negative standard reduction\npotential and so serves as the anode. In the case of iron and copper (0.34 V), iron has the smaller standard\nreduction potential and so corrodes (serves as the anode).\n42. While the reduction potential of lithium would make it capable of protecting the other metals, this high\npotential is also indicative of how reactive lithium is; it would have a spontaneous reaction with most\nsubstances. This means that the lithium would react quickly with other substances, even those that would\nnot oxidize the metal it is attempting to protect. Reactivity like this means the sacrificial anode would be\ndepleted rapidly and need to be replaced frequently. (Optional additional reason: fire hazard in the\npresence of water.)\n46.

The radioactive isotope is contained in tubes called fuel rods.\n2.\nA moderator. A moderator slows neutrons produced by nuclear reactions so that they can be absorbed\nby the fuel and cause additional nuclear reactions.\n3.\nA coolant. The coolant carries heat from the fission reaction to an external boiler and turbine where it\nis transformed into electricity.\n4.\nA control system.
