Data Privacy Policy
Effective Date: [Date]
Last Updated: [Date]
1. Introduction
Vividly ("Vividly," "we," "us," or "our") provides a personalized learning application and service (the "Service") designed for K-12 educational institutions ("Schools," "Districts," "you," or "your"). This Data Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from student Education Records, when providing the Service to Schools pursuant to a contractual agreement.
This Policy is designed to comply with applicable privacy laws, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the Tennessee Information Protection Act (TIPA), and other relevant state and federal regulations governing student data.
By entering into an agreement with Vividly and using the Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
2. FERPA Compliance & Our Role as a "School Official"
Vividly understands the importance of protecting student privacy. In providing the Service to Schools, Vividly acts as a "School Official" under FERPA (34 CFR ยง 99.31(a)(1)) based on the following conditions met through our contractual agreement with the School/District:
Institutional Service: Vividly performs an institutional service or function for which the School would otherwise use its own employees (providing supplemental personalized learning content).
Legitimate Educational Interest: Vividly requires access to specific PII from student Education Records solely to perform these contracted services and improve educational outcomes.
Direct Control: Vividly operates under the direct control of the School/District concerning the use and maintenance of PII from Education Records. The School/District remains in control of the student data shared with Vividly.
Use Limitation: Vividly uses PII from Education Records only for the authorized educational purposes specified in our agreement with the School/District and does not use it for any other purpose. PII is not disclosed to third parties except as outlined in this policy and our agreement, and under the direction of the School/District or as required by law.
3. COPPA Compliance
Vividly is committed to complying with COPPA. The Service is intended for use by students in a K-12 setting under the direction and supervision of their School/District.
Consent: When Vividly collects personal information from students under the age of 13, it does so solely for educational purposes at the direction of the School/District. In this context, Vividly relies on the School/District to provide consent on behalf of parents/guardians as permitted by COPPA (acting in loco parentis) for the collection of student personal information within the school context.
No Other Use: Vividly does not collect personal information from children under 13 for any other commercial purpose, nor do we enable children under 13 to make their personal information publicly available.
If Vividly learns that it has inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13 outside of the directed educational context without appropriate parental consent, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. Parents who believe we might have collected information from their child under 13 inappropriately should contact us immediately at [Privacy Contact Email].
4. Information We Collect
We practice data minimization and collect only the information reasonably necessary to provide and improve the Service for educational purposes as directed by the School/District. This may include:
Student Information (Provided by School/District): Student name, school affiliation (school, class), unique student identifier (if provided by the school), grade level.
Student-Provided Information: Ranked list of interests (selected from a predefined list managed by Vividly or the School).
Usage Information: Data about how students interact with the Service, such as topics accessed, videos watched, feedback provided ("Mark as Complete," "Make it Simpler," "Try Different Interest"), session duration, features used, and technical data (IP address, browser type, device information for operational purposes only).
Teacher/Administrator Information: Name, email address, school affiliation, role, classes managed.
5. How We Use Information
Information collected is used strictly for educational purposes as authorized by the School/District, including:
To provide, operate, maintain, and improve the Service.
To personalize learning content (scripts, audio, video) based on student interests.
To generate audio and video lessons.
To track student progress within the Service as directed by teachers and administrators.
To respond to requests from Schools/Districts and provide support.
To monitor usage, analyze trends, and improve the Service's effectiveness and security (using aggregated and de-identified data where possible).
To comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms.
Prohibited Uses: Vividly will not:
Use PII from Education Records for targeted advertising to students or parents.
Build personal profiles of students for any purpose other than supporting authorized educational purposes.
Sell student PII.
Disclose PII except as outlined in this policy and our agreement with the School/District.
6. Information Sharing and Disclosure
Vividly does not share or disclose PII from Education Records except in the following limited circumstances:
Service Providers: We may share information with third-party vendors who perform services on our behalf (e.g., cloud hosting providers, TTS API providers, video generation API providers). These providers are contractually obligated to handle the data securely, use it only for the purpose of providing services to Vividly, maintain confidentiality, and are prohibited from re-disclosing the information or using it for their own purposes.
School/District Direction: As directed or permitted by our agreement with the School/District.
Legal Requirements: If required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect safety, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
Business Transfer: In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, PII may be transferred, provided the successor entity is bound by privacy commitments materially similar to this policy and FERPA. Schools will be notified in advance of such a transfer.
Aggregated/De-Identified Data: We may share aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably identify an individual student for research, reporting, or service improvement purposes.
7. Data Security
Vividly implements reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures designed to protect the information we collect from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These measures include encryption of data in transit and at rest, access controls, employee training, and regular security assessments.
In the event of a data breach involving PII, Vividly will notify the affected School/District promptly in accordance with our contractual agreement and applicable laws.
8. Data Retention and Deletion
We retain PII from Education Records only for the period necessary to provide the Service as specified in our agreement with the School/District, or as required by law. Upon termination of the agreement or at the direction of the School/District, Vividly will securely delete or return student PII in accordance with the terms of the agreement and applicable law. We will provide certification of deletion upon request.
Cached generated content (audio/video) associated with anonymized keys (topic, interest, style) may be retained for service efficiency but will be disassociated from any student PII upon deletion request or contract termination.
9. Parent and Student Rights (Access, Review, Amendment)
Under FERPA, parents or eligible students (students 18 or older) have the right to inspect and review the student's Education Records maintained by the school, and to request amendments to records they believe are inaccurate or misleading.
Vividly processes PII under the direction of the School/District. Parents and eligible students should direct any requests to access, review, or amend PII held within the Vividly Service to their School/District. Vividly will assist the School/District in responding to such verified requests in accordance with our contractual agreement.
10. Policy Updates
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify the designated contact(s) at the School/District via email or through the Service administrative interface prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage School/District representatives to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
