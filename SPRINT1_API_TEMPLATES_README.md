## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Code Style
- ✅ Follows existing codebase patterns (feature_flags.py style)
- ✅ FastAPI with Pydantic validation
- ✅ Type hints throughout
- ✅ Comprehensive docstrings
- ✅ OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- ✅ Dependency injection pattern

### Security Features
- ✅ Password strength validation (8+ chars, mixed case, number)
- ✅ bcrypt hashing with cost factor 12
- ✅ JWT with 24h access token, 30d refresh token
- ✅ Token rotation on refresh
- ✅ Token blacklist on logout
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Password reset with 1-hour token expiration

### Validation
- ✅ Email format validation
- ✅ Role validation (student, teacher)
- ✅ Grade level validation (9-12)
- ✅ Interest limits (1-5, no duplicates)
- ✅ Subject whitelist
- ✅ Duplicate prevention (email, class codes)

### API Design
- ✅ RESTful endpoints
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 204, 401, 403, 404, 409, 422, 429)
- ✅ Consistent error response format
- ✅ Cursor-based pagination
- ✅ Query parameter filtering
- ✅ Soft deletes (archive pattern)

## 📋 Next Steps for Engineers

### For Each Endpoint:
1. **Review TODO comments** - Each TODO block outlines exactly what needs to be implemented
2. **Implement database queries** - Use SQLAlchemy models (create if not exist)
3. **Implement business logic** - Follow the TODO instructions step by step
4. **Add helper functions** - Create reusable functions for:
   - Password hashing/verification
   - JWT generation/validation
   - Progress calculation
   - Streak calculation
   - Topic matrix building
5. **Write unit tests** - Target >85% coverage per acceptance criteria
6. **Write integration tests** - Test full request/response flows
7. **Update API documentation** - Ensure OpenAPI docs are complete

### Database Setup Required:
- Configure `get_db()` dependency with SQLAlchemy session
- Create database models (User, Class, StudentInterest, etc.)
- Run migrations (feature flags and request tracking already ready)

### Third-Party Services:
- **Redis**: For token blacklist and rate limiting
- **Email service**: For welcome emails, password reset, notifications (stub with logger for now)
- **JWT library**: For token generation and validation

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

Each story includes acceptance criteria requiring:
- **Unit tests**: 4-6 test cases per story
- **Integration tests**: 1-2 full flow tests per story
- **Test coverage**: >85% for backend code

### Example Test Cases (Story 1.1.1 Registration):
1. ✅ Valid registration returns 201 with user object
2. ✅ Password is hashed in database
3. ✅ Duplicate email returns 409 Conflict
4. ✅ Invalid email returns 422 Validation Error
5. ✅ Weak password returns 422 with helpful message
6. ✅ Welcome email queued (logged)
7. ✅ SQL injection attempts blocked

## 📖 API Contract Examples

All endpoints include full API contract examples in docstrings. Example:

```python
POST /api/v1/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "student@mnps.edu",
  "password": "SecurePass123!",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "role": "student",
  "grade_level": 10
}

# Response (201 Created)
{
  "user_id": "user_abc123",
  "email": "student@mnps.edu",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "role": "student",
  "grade_level": 10,
  "created_at": "2025-11-04T10:00:00Z"
}
```

## 🚀 Ready to Code!

All 28 story points from Sprint 1 are now templateized and ready for implementation. Engineers can:
1. Pick a story from the sprint backlog
2. Open the corresponding route file
3. Follow the TODO comments step by step
4. Implement, test, commit, and move to next story

**Estimated Time**: 28 story points = ~5 working days for 2 engineers (as per sprint plan)
